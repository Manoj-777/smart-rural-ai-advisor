# Problem Statement

## The Challenge

**70% of India's population depends on agriculture**, yet small-scale farmers face critical information gaps:

1. **No access to expert advice** — Agricultural extension officers cover 1,000+ farmers each
2. **Language barriers** — Most agricultural resources are in English; farmers speak Tamil, Hindi, Telugu, Kannada
3. **Delayed pest/disease response** — By the time farmers identify crop diseases, significant damage has occurred
4. **Unawareness of government schemes** — ₹2+ lakh crore in benefits go unclaimed annually
5. **Weather unpredictability** — Climate change makes traditional farming calendars unreliable

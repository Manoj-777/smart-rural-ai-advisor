High-Yield Varieties: Local improved cultivars per region (e.g., Nadan, Alleppey types)

Harvest Indicator: Yellowing and drying of leaves; 7–9 months maturity

Key Nutrients

NPK Requirement: 150–200:80–100:200–250 kg/ha (split)

Micronutrients: Zn, B where low

Market Info

Market: Spices market & processing for turmeric powder/curcumin extraction

Pricing: Quality (color & curcumin content) drives premium

Common Diseases

Leaf blotch, Rhizome rot (Pythium), bacterial wilt

Traditional Wisdom

Intercropping with coconut and banana practiced; well-timed harvesting and curing improves quality and color.

19. Black Gram (Urad Dal)

Botanical Name: Vigna mungo
Crop Type: Pulse / Kharif & Rabi (short duration types)
Growing Season: Jun–Oct (kharif), Nov–Mar (rabi short duration in irrigated fields)
Duration: 70–120 days (varieties vary)

Soil Requirements

Ideal Soil: Well-drained loamy soils; tolerates light soils

pH Range: 6.0–7.5

Drainage: Good; waterlogging reduces nodulation

Climate & Water

Rainfall: 400–700 mm (monsoon dependent)

Water Need: 300–450 mm per cycle; drought tolerant to an extent

Irrigation: 1–3 irrigations during drought stress, critical at flowering & pod fill

Regions in India

Major States: Maharashtra, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar

Best Suited: Rainfed and residual moisture-based systems

Planting Guide

Seed Rate: 10–20 kg/ha (varies by seed size & method)

Spacing: 30–40 cm × 10–15 cm for higher plant population (depends on variety)

Sowing Depth: 3–4 cm

Yield

Average Yield: 0.5–1.2 t/ha (rainfed), 1.5–2.5 t/ha (irrigated/high input)

High-Yield Varieties: Regional improved varieties (TU, PU series)

Harvest Indicator: Pods dry and plants turn pale; seed moisture 12–14%

Key Nutrients

NPK Requirement: 10–20:30–40:10–20 kg/ha (P and K important), biological N fixation provides N

Micronutrients: Mo for nodulation where deficient

Market Info

MSP: Pulses have periodic MSP support; check latest official notice.

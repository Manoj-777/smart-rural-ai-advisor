## ✅ Data Quality Guidelines

When using these resources to update the knowledge base:

1. **Prioritize .gov.in and .ac.in domains** — most reliable Indian data
2. **Cross-verify critical numbers** (yield, MSP, dosage) across 2-3 sources
3. **Use current season data** — MSP updates every Kharif/Rabi season
4. **Cite specific varieties by region** — avoid generic "use HYV" advice
5. **Include both organic AND chemical treatments** — farmers use both
6. **Provide actionable steps** — "apply 2g/L Carbendazim at booting stage" not "apply fungicide"
7. **Mention subsidy amounts with year** — subsidies change annually
8. **Test farmer understanding** — if a farmer can't act on the info, simplify it
9. **Multilingual readiness** — all data should be translatable to Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Marathi, Bengali, Gujarati, Punjabi

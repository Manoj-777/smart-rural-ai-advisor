## 6. Price Advisory for Farmers

### When to Sell — General Guidelines

- **Rice:** Sell after January when private traders compete with FCI procurement. Prices tend to peak in March-April.
- **Wheat:** Best prices in April-May immediately post-harvest. Store for 2-3 months for 10-15% premium.
- **Cotton:** Monitor international prices. Sell in batches — 50% at harvest, 50% in February-March.
- **Toor/Chana/Moong:** Pulse prices are highly seasonal. Peak prices usually in June-September (off-season).
- **Soybean:** Sell early in the season (October-November) if prices are near MSP. Late sales risk price drops.
- **Vegetables:** Highly volatile — sell through eNAM or direct market linkages for best prices.

### How to Get MSP

1. Register at your nearest APMC/Mandi
2. Check eNAM (National Agriculture Market) registration: `enam.gov.in`
3. Bring produce during govt procurement window (varies by state)
4. Carry farmer ID card, land ownership documents
5. Grading & quality testing at mandi — MSP requires FAQ (Fair Average Quality)

## 7. State-wise Price Variations

Prices vary significantly across states due to local demand, transportation costs, and procurement policies.

### Rice Price Hotspots

- **Tamil Nadu:** Thanjavur, Nagapattinam mandis; prices peak April-May
- **Andhra Pradesh/Telangana:** Nalgonda, Nizamabad; direct procurement centers available

### Wheat Price Hotspots
- **Madhya Pradesh:** Largest wheat producer; Indore, Bhopal, Sehore mandis
- **Punjab:** Government procurement strong; Khanna, Amritsar mandis
- **Uttar Pradesh:** Hapur, Lucknow; monitor Rabi procurement dates

### Cotton Price Hotspots
- **Gujarat:** Rajkot, Gondal — highest cotton trading volumes
- **Maharashtra:** Jalgaon, Akola, Nagpur local mandis
- **Telangana/AP:** Adilabad, Guntur — CCI procurement active

### Vegetable Price Hotspots
- **Tomato:** Kolar (Karnataka), Madanapalle (AP), Nashik (Maharashtra) — price fluctuations can be 5-10x

## 8. Understanding MSP vs Market Price

- **MSP (Minimum Support Price):** Government-set floor price to protect farmers. Announced before sowing season by CCEA (Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs).
- **Market Price:** Actual trading prices at mandis (APMC markets). Can be above or below MSP depending on demand-supply.
- **FRP (Fair & Remunerative Price):** Specific to sugarcane, set by Centre; states may announce higher SAP (State Advised Price).

### Key Insight for Farmers
If market price > MSP → Sell in open market for better returns
If market price < MSP → Sell through government procurement channels (FCI/NAFED/CCI)
Always compare 3-4 nearby mandi prices before selling (use eNAM app)

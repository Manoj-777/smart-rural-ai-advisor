## SECTION A: Major Crop Diseases

### A1. Rice Blast

**Scientific Name:** Pyricularia oryzae (Magnaporthe oryzae)
**Crop Affected:** Rice (all varieties, especially high-yield varieties like Pusa Basmati, Swarna)
**Type:** Fungal
**Season/Conditions:** Kharif season, high humidity (>90%), temperature 25-28°C, overcast/cloudy weather, excessive nitrogen application, closely spaced planting

**Symptoms:**
- **Leaf blast:** Diamond/spindle-shaped spots with grey centre and brown margin on leaves (0.5-1.5 cm long)
- **Neck blast:** Infection at panicle base — neck turns brown/black, panicle breaks or droops, grain filling stops completely
- **Node blast:** Blackish lesions on stem nodes, stem weakens and breaks
- **Early stage:** Small blue-green specks (pin-head size) that enlarge rapidly within 3-5 days

**Economic Impact:** Can cause 50-90% yield loss in severe outbreaks. Neck blast is most destructive — entire panicle is lost. India loses an estimated ₹7,000-10,000 crore annually to rice blast.

**Organic/Traditional Treatment:**
- Spray Pseudomonas fluorescens @ 10 g/L or 2.5 kg/ha as preventive (2-3 sprays at 10-day intervals)
- Apply Trichoderma viride @ 5 g/L as foliar spray
- Neem oil 5% spray reduces spore germination
- Maintain 20×15 cm spacing — avoid dense planting to improve air circulation
- Drain fields periodically to reduce microclimate humidity

**Chemical Treatment:**
- **Preventive:** Tricyclazole 75 WP @ 0.6 g/L (spray at tillering + booting stage)
- **Curative:** Isoprothiolane 40 EC @ 1.5 mL/L (spray at first symptom appearance)
- **Alternative:** Carbendazim 50 WP @ 1 g/L or Edifenphos 50 EC @ 1 mL/L
- **Combination:** Tricyclazole 18% + Mancozeb 62% WP @ 2.5 g/L (broad-spectrum protection)

**Prevention:**
- Use resistant varieties: IR-64, Tetep, Rasi, Co-39, Pusa 1602 (blast-resistant)
- Balanced fertilization — apply nitrogen in 3 splits (basal + tillering + panicle initiation), do NOT exceed 120 kg N/ha
- Remove and burn infected stubble after harvest (pathogen survives in debris)
- Treat seeds with Carbendazim 50 WP @ 2 g/kg or Tricyclazole @ 3 g/kg before sowing
- Avoid late planting — early Kharif planting escapes peak blast period

### A2. Wheat Rust (Yellow/Brown/Black Rust)

**Scientific Name:** Puccinia striiformis f.sp. tritici (Yellow/Stripe rust), Puccinia triticina (Brown/Leaf rust), Puccinia graminis f.sp. tritici (Black/Stem rust)
**Crop Affected:** Wheat (all varieties, though severity varies)
**Type:** Fungal (Obligate parasite — Basidiomycetes)
**Season/Conditions:** Yellow rust appears first in cooler areas (Dec-Jan) at 10-15°C with dew/light rain; Brown rust at 15-25°C (Jan-Feb) with high humidity; Black rust at 25-30°C (Feb-Mar), late season. All need moisture on leaf surface for spore germination.

**Symptoms:**
- **Yellow rust (Stripe rust):** Yellow-orange powdery pustules arranged in linear stripes/rows along leaf veins. Appears first on lower leaves, moves upward. Leaves turn yellow and dry prematurely. Most damaging at ear emergence.
- **Brown rust (Leaf rust):** Small, round to oval, orange-brown pustules scattered randomly on upper leaf surface (not in rows). Leaves look "rusty". Most common rust in India. Pustules 1-2 mm diameter.
- **Black rust (Stem rust):** Large, dark reddish-brown to black pustules on stems, leaf sheaths, and glumes. Pustules rupture epidermis — rough to touch. Appears late in season. Can destroy crop within 2-3 weeks if conditions favourable.

**Economic Impact:** Yellow rust can cause 40-100% loss in susceptible varieties. Brown rust causes 10-30% yield reduction (most widespread). Black rust is potentially the most devastating (historically caused famines) but now rare due to resistant varieties. Combined annual loss: ₹2,000-5,000 crore in India.

**Organic/Traditional Treatment:**
- Remove alternate host plants (Berberis spp.) near wheat fields
- Apply Pseudomonas fluorescens @ 10 g/L as preventive foliar spray at tillering
- Spray neem oil 2% at 15-day intervals starting from CRI stage
- Early sowing (before Nov 15 in North India) helps crop escape late-season black rust

**Chemical Treatment:**
- **Preventive:** Mancozeb 75 WP @ 2.5 g/L (2 sprays at 15-day intervals from first symptom)
- **Curative (Best option):** Propiconazole 25 EC (Tilt) @ 1 mL/L — single spray controls all three rusts for 15-20 days
- **Alternative:** Tebuconazole 25.9 EC @ 1 mL/L
- **Combination:** Trifloxystrobin 25% + Tebuconazole 50% WG (Nativo) @ 0.4 g/L
- **Timing:** First spray at disease appearance, second spray 15 days later. Do NOT spray after grain filling (dough stage).

**Prevention:**
- **Most important:** Grow resistant varieties — HD-3226 (Pusa Yashasvi), DBW-187, PBW-826, WH-1270 (check ICAR-IIWBR latest recommendations)
- Early sowing: Complete sowing by Nov 15 (North India) to escape rust window
- Avoid excessive nitrogen — promotes lush growth susceptible to rust
- Balanced potassium application improves rust resistance
- Monitor ICAR Rust Surveillance Advisory (issued weekly Dec-Mar) for early warning
- Destroy volunteer wheat and self-sown wheat plants that harbour rust between seasons

### A3. Cotton Bollworm (American Bollworm)

**Scientific Name:** Helicoverpa armigera (Hübner)
**Crop Affected:** Cotton (primary). Also severely attacks chickpea (gram), tomato, pigeon pea (toor), maize, sunflower, groundnut, sorghum — India's most polyphagous pest.
**Type:** Insect pest — Lepidoptera (Noctuidae). Moth lays eggs, larvae (caterpillars) cause damage.
**Season/Conditions:** Active throughout Kharif season (Jul-Nov). Peak damage during cotton boll formation (Aug-Oct). Moths active at dusk. Thrives in warm (25-35°C), humid conditions. Outbreaks worse in years with intermittent dry spells during monsoon.

**Symptoms:**
- **On cotton:** Young larvae feed on squares (flower buds) and flowers. Older larvae bore into bolls — entry hole with frass (excreta) visible outside. Boll rots from inside, opens prematurely, lint stained and unmarketable. One larva can destroy 20-30 bolls in its lifetime.
- **On tomato:** Larvae bore into green/ripe fruits. Circular entry hole, fruit rots. Multiple fruits on same plant attacked.
- **On chickpea:** Larvae feed inside pods, consuming developing grains. Green frass pellets visible on plant.
- **Egg identification:** Round, yellowish-white eggs (0.5 mm) laid singly on tender plant parts (terminals, flowers, young bolls).
- **Larva identification:** Green to brown caterpillar, 30-40 mm when mature, with dark lateral stripes and scattered dark spots. Nocturnal feeders.

**Economic Impact:** India's costliest crop pest — annual losses estimated at ₹5,000-10,000 crore across all host crops. Can destroy 50-80% of cotton bolls in severe outbreaks. Before Bt cotton, farmers spent ₹2,000-4,000/acre on bollworm insecticides alone.

**Organic/Traditional Treatment:**
- **Pheromone traps:** Install Helicoverpa pheromone traps @ 5 traps/acre at flowering stage. Monitor moth catches — spray when >8 moths/trap/night
- **Trichogramma chilonis:** Release egg parasitoid @ 1.5 lakh eggs/ha (6-8 releases at weekly intervals from squaring stage). Available from KVKs and biocontrol labs
- **HaNPV (Nuclear Polyhedrosis Virus):** Spray @ 250 LE (Larval Equivalents)/ha at first larva sighting. Apply in evening (UV-sensitive). Mix with 0.1% jaggery solution as feeding stimulant
- **Neem seed kernel extract (NSKE):** 5% spray (50 g neem seed kernel powder in 1 litre water, filter and spray) — acts as antifeedant and growth regulator
- **Bird perches:** Erect T-shaped bird perches @ 50/ha — attracts insectivorous birds (shrikes, drongos)
- **Intercropping:** Grow trap crops — pigeon pea, marigold around cotton field margins. Helicoverpa lays eggs on trap crop, reduces cotton damage

**Chemical Treatment:**
- **Threshold for spraying:** >5% damage to squares or >10% damaged bolls, OR 1 larva/plant
- **First choice:** Emamectin benzoate 5 SG @ 0.4 g/L (very effective against all larval stages)
- **Alternative 1:** Chlorantraniliprole 18.5 SC (Coragen) @ 0.3 mL/L — safe for natural enemies
- **Alternative 2:** Spinosad 45 SC @ 0.3 mL/L (derived from soil bacterium, IPM-compatible)
- **Alternative 3:** Indoxacarb 14.5 SC @ 0.5 mL/L
- **AVOID:** Synthetic pyrethroids (cypermethrin, deltamethrin) — Helicoverpa has developed high resistance in most Indian regions. Avoid organophosphates repeatedly.
- **Rotation:** Rotate chemical groups in each spray to prevent resistance. Never use same insecticide group more than 2 times in a season.

**Prevention:**
- **Bt cotton:** Grow approved Bt cotton hybrids (BG-II) containing Cry1Ac + Cry2Ab genes — provides 80-90% bollworm protection. Plant 20% non-Bt refuge (5 rows around Bt field) as per government mandate
- Deep summer ploughing to expose pupae to sun and predators
- Remove and destroy crop residues after harvest — pupae survive in soil
- Avoid continuous cotton monoculture — rotate with non-host crops (wheat, millets, groundnut)
- Early sowing (before June 15 in Central India) helps crop escape peak moth flight
- Install light traps @ 1/5 acres to monitor adult moth activity

### A4. Late Blight of Potato & Tomato

**Scientific Name:** Phytophthora infestans (Mont.) de Bary
**Crop Affected:** Potato (primary host), Tomato (major host). Also affects brinjal, chilli, capsicum, and other Solanaceae family crops.
**Type:** Oomycete (water mould) — often grouped with fungi but technically a separate kingdom. Spreads through airborne sporangia.
**Season/Conditions:** Cool, wet weather — optimal at 15-22°C with relative humidity >90% and prolonged leaf wetness (>10 hours). In India, severe during Rabi season (Nov-Feb) in Indo-Gangetic plains, and during monsoon (Jul-Sep) in hills and South India. Fog and drizzle create ideal infection conditions.

**Symptoms:**
- **Potato leaves:** Irregular, water-soaked, pale green to dark brown lesions starting from leaf tips and margins. White cottony fungal growth (sporangia) visible on underside of leaves in early morning. Leaves blacken and die rapidly — entire foliage can be destroyed in 7-10 days ("blighting").
- **Potato tubers:** Reddish-brown, irregular, shallow depressions on skin. Internal tissue shows rusty-brown dry rot extending inward from surface. Infected tubers rot in storage, often with secondary bacterial soft rot.
- **Tomato:** Dark brown water-soaked lesions on leaves, stems, and green fruits. Fruits develop dark, firm, greasy-looking spots. White sporulation on fruit surface in humid conditions.
- **Disease spread:** Extremely fast — one infected plant can spread disease to entire field in 5-7 days under favourable conditions. Sporangia travel by wind up to 10-15 km.

**Economic Impact:** Historically the most devastating crop disease (caused Irish Potato Famine, 1845). In India, causes 20-75% potato yield loss in epidemic years. Annual loss in potato alone estimated at ₹3,000-5,000 crore. Tomato losses of 30-60% common in hill regions.

**Organic/Traditional Treatment:**
- Spray Trichoderma viride @ 5 g/L as preventive from 30 days after planting, repeat every 10 days
- Bordeaux mixture (1% — prepared from 1 kg CuSO4 + 1 kg lime + 100 L water) — oldest effective treatment, still widely used. Spray every 7-10 days in disease-prone period
- Good drainage — avoid waterlogging. Ridge planting reduces tuber infection
- Remove and destroy first infected plants immediately (rogue out) to slow spread

**Chemical Treatment:**
- **Preventive (before disease appears):** Mancozeb 75 WP @ 2.5 g/L — spray starting 30-35 days after planting, repeat every 7-10 days during cool-wet weather
- **Curative (after disease appears):** Metalaxyl 8% + Mancozeb 64% WP (Ridomil Gold) @ 2.5 g/L — systemic + contact action
- **Alternative:** Cymoxanil 8% + Mancozeb 64% WP (Curzate M8) @ 3 g/L
- **Advanced option:** Dimethomorph 50 WP @ 1 g/L or Fenamidone 10% + Mancozeb 50% WDG @ 3 g/L
- **Spray schedule:** Start preventive sprays at 30-35 DAP. If disease appears, switch to curative fungicide. Alternate contact + systemic fungicides to prevent resistance. Total 5-7 sprays per season.

**Prevention:**
- Use certified disease-free seed tubers (from cold storage, treated with Mancozeb 0.25% dip)
- Grow resistant varieties: Kufri Jyoti, Kufri Badshah, Kufri Girdhari (potato); Arka Rakshak, Arka Samrat (tomato — contain Ph-2 and Ph-3 resistance genes)
- Avoid overhead irrigation — use furrow or drip to keep foliage dry
- Adequate spacing for air circulation (60×20 cm for potato)
- Hilling up (earthing up) — covers tubers, prevents sporangia from reaching tubers through soil
- Dehaulming — cut and remove foliage 10-15 days before harvest to prevent tuber infection
- Use ICAR-CPRI late blight forecast model (www.cpri.org.in) — spray schedule based on weather prediction

### A5. Bacterial Leaf Blight (BLB) of Rice

**Scientific Name:** Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo)
**Crop Affected:** Rice (all varieties, especially susceptible during Kharif)
**Type:** Bacterial
**Season/Conditions:** High temperature (25-34°C), high humidity (>80%), heavy rainfall, strong winds (spread bacteria through wounds), excessive nitrogen fertilization, clipping of leaf tips during transplanting. Most severe during tillering to flowering stage.

**Symptoms:**
- **Kresek (seedling wilt):** Seedlings in nursery wilt and die within 2-3 weeks of transplanting. Leaves turn pale yellow and roll. Entire plant dries up. Occurs when infected seedlings are transplanted.
- **Leaf blight phase:** Water-soaked lesions start from leaf tip or margins, turning yellow to white and drying along leaf veins. Lesions extend downward and inward. Affected leaves dry completely, turning straw-coloured.
- **Bacterial ooze:** In early morning (with dew), yellowish bacterial ooze (milky droplets) visible at leaf edges — confirmatory diagnostic sign.
- **Entire field view:** Field looks scorched — white-yellow dried leaves visible from distance. Grain filling severely affected.

**Economic Impact:** Yield loss of 20-50% in moderate infection, up to 80% in severe Kresek phase. Widespread in West Bengal, Odisha, eastern UP, Bihar, AP, and all high-rainfall rice areas.

**Organic/Traditional Treatment:**
- Spray Pseudomonas fluorescens @ 10 g/L at 15-day intervals starting from tillering (proven effective in reducing BLB severity by 40-50%)
- Apply fresh cowdung extract (20%) as foliar spray — traditional practice in eastern India, provides some suppression
- Drain excess water from fields — standing water promotes bacterial spread
- Avoid clipping leaf tips during transplanting (creates entry wounds for bacteria)

**Chemical Treatment:**
- **Note:** Antibiotics and chemical fungicides have LIMITED effect on BLB. Copper-based compounds are the best chemical option.
- **Copper oxychloride 50 WP @ 3 g/L** — spray at first symptom, repeat after 10 days
- **Streptomycin sulphate 0.01% (100 ppm)** + Copper oxychloride 0.05% — combination spray
- **Copper hydroxide 77 WP @ 2.5 g/L** — alternative copper formulation
- **Avoid:** Regular fungicides (Carbendazim, Mancozeb) are NOT effective against BLB — it's bacterial, not fungal

**Prevention:**
- **Resistant varieties (BEST strategy):** Improved Samba Mahsuri (ISM), Pusa 1460, Rajendra Dhan-201, CR Dhan-310 (carry Xa21, xa13, xa5 resistance genes)
- Do NOT clip seedling leaf tips during transplanting
- Balanced NPK — reduce nitrogen to 80-100 kg/ha in BLB-prone areas (excess N increases susceptibility dramatically)
- Apply potassium (K₂O @ 60 kg/ha) — potassium strengthens cell walls against bacterial entry
- Avoid flood irrigation immediately after strong winds/storms (wounds + bacteria + water = rapid spread)
- Seed treatment with Streptocycline (0.01%) for 30 minutes before sowing

### A6. Downy Mildew of Millets (Pearl Millet / Bajra)

**Scientific Name:** Sclerospora graminicola (Sacc.) Schroet.
**Crop Affected:** Pearl millet (Bajra) — primary host. Also affects foxtail millet, sorghum (different Sclerospora species).
**Type:** Oomycete (downy mildew pathogen)
**Season/Conditions:** Kharif season. Cool nights (20-25°C) followed by warm days (30-35°C), high soil moisture at seedling stage, relative humidity >85%. Sandy and sandy-loam soils with poor drainage. Pathogen survives as oospores in soil for 5-10 years.

**Symptoms:**
- **Seedling stage:** Chlorosis (yellowing) of leaves starting from base. Leaves show half-leaf chlorosis (green-yellow boundary along midrib). White cottony fungal growth on underside of leaves (visible in early morning).
- **"Green ear" / "crazy top":** Most characteristic symptom — panicle (ear head) is transformed into a green leafy structure instead of grain-bearing ear. Florets turn into leaf-like growths. Severely infected plants produce no grain at all.
- **Systemic infection:** Entire plant is stunted with excessive tillering (witch's broom appearance). Leaves thick, leathery, light green to yellow. Plant remains vegetative — does not flower normally.

**Economic Impact:** Major constraint to bajra production in Rajasthan, Gujarat, Haryana, Maharashtra. Can cause 30-70% yield loss in susceptible hybrids. Severe epidemics occurred in 1970s when first single-cross hybrids (HB-3) were introduced without DM resistance.

**Organic/Traditional Treatment:**
- Apply Trichoderma viride @ 4 g/kg seed as seed treatment
- Mix FYM (Farm Yard Manure) with Trichoderma (1 kg Trichoderma in 100 kg FYM, incubate 7 days) — apply to soil before sowing
- Remove and destroy infected plants (roguing) as soon as green ear symptoms appear — prevents oospore buildup in soil
- Crop rotation with non-host crops (legumes, oilseeds) for 3 years to reduce soil oospore load

**Chemical Treatment:**
- **Seed treatment (MOST effective):** Metalaxyl 35 SD (Apron) @ 6 g/kg seed — provides systemic protection for 30-40 days. This single treatment prevents 80-90% of downy mildew.
- **Alternative seed treatment:** Metalaxyl 2 g + Thiram 3 g per kg seed
- **Foliar spray (if symptoms appear):** Metalaxyl 8% + Mancozeb 64% WP (Ridomil Gold) @ 2.5 g/L — spray at 20-25 DAS
- **Soil application:** Metalaxyl granules @ 1 kg a.i./ha mixed with sand, broadcast at sowing in severely infested fields

**Prevention:**
- **Resistant hybrids (CRITICAL):** Grow ICRISAT/ICAR-released DM-resistant hybrids — HHB-67 Improved, GHB-558, RHB-173, RHB-177, MPMH-17. Check state agricultural university recommendation for your region
- Seed treatment with Metalaxyl is mandatory in DM-endemic areas
- Avoid planting same hybrid in the same field for more than 3 consecutive years (pathogen overcomes resistance)
- Deep ploughing in summer — exposes soil oospores to sunlight and desiccation
- Avoid waterlogging at seedling stage

### A7. Panama Wilt of Banana (Fusarium Wilt)

**Scientific Name:** Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. cubense (Foc) — Race 1 (affects Rasthali, Monthan, Silk varieties) and Tropical Race 4 / TR4 (threatens Cavendish/Grand Naine — GLOBAL EMERGENCY)
**Crop Affected:** Banana — all varieties susceptible to one or more races
**Type:** Fungal (Soil-borne — Fusarium)
**Season/Conditions:** Warm temperatures (25-30°C), acidic soils (pH < 6.0), waterlogged or poorly drained soils, mechanical root damage (during weeding/ploughing), presence of root-knot nematodes. Fungus survives in soil for 20-30+ years as chlamydospores.

**Symptoms:**
- **External:** Yellowing of oldest (lower) leaves starting from leaf margins, progressing inward. Yellowed leaves droop and hang around pseudostem like a "skirt". Pseudostem may split at base. Plant wilts and collapses. Typically affects plants at 5-7 months (before or during fruiting).
- **Internal (confirmatory):** Cut the pseudostem cross-wise — dark brown to reddish-brown discoloration of vascular bundles visible (ring of brown dots/lines in cross-section). This vascular browning is the hallmark diagnostic sign.
- **Root system:** Brown, rotted roots. Rhizome shows brown vascular streaks.
- **Progression:** Disease is one-sided initially — only some leaf sheaths show browning. Eventually entire plant dies. Bunches if present are small with thin, unmarketable fingers.

**Economic Impact:** One of the most devastating banana diseases globally. Destroyed Gros Michel banana industry worldwide in the 1950s. In India, Race 1 causes significant losses in traditional varieties (Rasthali in TN, Monthan in Kerala). **TR4 is the biggest threat** — first reported in India in Bihar (2017) and has potential to devastate the ₹50,000 crore Indian banana industry.

**Organic/Traditional Treatment:**
- Apply Trichoderma viride (or T. harzianum) @ 50 g/plant in planting pit — repeat at 2-month intervals (colonizes root zone, suppresses Fusarium)
- Apply Pseudomonas fluorescens @ 20 g/plant in planting pit
- Drench soil with Carbendazim 50 WP @ 2 g/L as a bio-chemical approach
- Apply neem cake @ 2 kg/planting pit (releases azadirachtin which suppresses soil fungi)
- Maintain soil pH at 6.5-7.0 by liming acidic soils (Fusarium thrives in acidic soils)
- Avoid flood irrigation — use drip to prevent waterlogging and root damage

**Chemical Treatment:**
- **Note:** No chemical treatment can CURE Panama wilt once plant is infected — the pathogen is inside vascular system. Focus is on soil treatment and prevention.
- **Soil drenching (preventive):** Carbendazim 50 WP @ 2 g/L — drench 10 litres around plant base at 3-month intervals
- **Planting pit treatment:** Carbendazim 25 g + Trichoderma 50 g per pit at planting
- **Infected plant management:** Inject affected plant with 2% Carbendazim (50 mL into pseudostem) — may save early-infected plants. Destroy severely infected plants completely (uproot, chop, burn or bury with quicklime)

**Prevention:**
- **Resistant varieties (MOST important):** Grand Naine (Cavendish) is resistant to Race 1 (but susceptible to TR4). For Race 1 areas: grow Grand Naine, Robusta, NRCB selection. For TR4: no fully resistant commercial variety yet — ICAR-NRCB is developing resistant lines
- Use tissue culture plantlets from certified labs (disease-free planting material)
- Strict quarantine — do NOT bring suckers from infected areas
- Apply lime @ 2 kg/pit if soil pH < 6.0
- Practice crop rotation — grow paddy (flooding kills Fusarium) for 2-3 years before replanting banana
- Avoid injuring roots during cultivation — Fusarium enters through wounds
- **TR4 containment:** If TR4 suspected — report immediately to state agriculture department. Quarantine zone, destroy infected plants, disinfect tools with 2% formalin. Do NOT move soil/suckers from affected area.

### A8. Bunchy Top of Banana (BBTV)

**Scientific Name:** Banana Bunchy Top Virus (BBTV) — Family Nanoviridae
**Crop Affected:** Banana (all varieties susceptible, Cavendish/Grand Naine most affected)
**Type:** Viral disease, transmitted by banana aphid (Pentalonia nigronervosa)
**Season/Conditions:** Year-round in tropical conditions. Aphid populations peak in warm, humid weather (25-30°C, >80% RH). Spread primarily through infected suckers (planting material) and aphid vectors. NOT transmitted through soil or mechanically.

**Symptoms:**
- **Leaf symptoms:** New leaves are narrow, shortened, with upturned/rolled margins. Leaves become stiff, brittle, and erect (bunched together at the top — hence "bunchy top"). Dark green streaks/dots ("Morse code" pattern or "J-hook" lines) along leaf veins and midrib — visible when held against light.
- **Plant growth:** Severely stunted plant. Internodes shortened — leaves appear crowded at apex. Plant remains dwarfed (rosetting).
- **Fruiting:** Infected plants rarely produce bunches. If bunches form, they are small with distorted, thin fingers. No economic yield.
- **Progression:** Once infected, the plant never recovers. Virus is systemic — spreads to suckers and ratoon crops.

**Economic Impact:** Most serious viral disease of banana in India. Can cause 100% loss in severely infected plantations. Major problem in Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Assam, Bihar. An estimated 10-20% of Indian banana plantations affected to some degree.

**Organic/Traditional Treatment:**
- **No cure exists for viral diseases.** Infected plants must be completely destroyed.
- Spray neem oil 2% or azadirachtin-based formulations to repel aphid vectors
- Release ladybird beetles (Coccinellids) — natural predators of aphids
- Apply sticky yellow traps around field periphery to trap migrating aphids
- Maintain clean field borders — remove weeds that harbour aphids

**Chemical Treatment (Vector Control):**
- **Aphid control is the only chemical management strategy:**
- Imidacloprid 17.8 SL @ 0.5 mL/L — systemic spray against aphids
- Dimethoate 30 EC @ 1.7 mL/L — spray on sucker/plant base where aphids colonize
- Thiamethoxam 25 WG @ 0.5 g/L — neonicotinoid for aphid control
- **Sucker dipping:** Dip suckers in Chlorpyrifos 20 EC @ 5 mL/L for 30 minutes before planting (kills aphids on planting material)
- **Inject:** Inject pseudostem of infected plants with Glyphosate 10 mL/plant before uprooting to kill plant and prevent regrowth

**Prevention:**
- **Virus-free planting material (MOST critical):** Use ONLY tissue culture plants from ICAR/State Government accredited labs. NEVER use suckers from infected areas.
- **Rogue immediately:** Uproot and destroy infected plants as soon as symptoms appear (within 7 days). Inject with herbicide, chop, and bury deep or burn.
- Spray aphicide (Imidacloprid) in 3m radius around infected plant before destroying it — kills aphid vectors that carry virus
- Maintain 3-year virus-free source nurseries
- Quarantine: Do NOT transport planting material from BBTV-endemic areas to clean zones
- Monitor field fortnightly — early detection + immediate destruction is the ONLY way to contain spread

### A9. Powdery Mildew (Chilli, Brinjal, Mango, Peas, Cucurbits)

**Scientific Name:** Leveillula taurica (Chilli, Brinjal), Oidium mangiferae (Mango), Erysiphe pisi (Peas), Podosphaera xanthii (Cucurbits — pumpkin, cucumber, watermelon)
**Crop Affected:** Chilli, brinjal (eggplant), mango (flowers + young fruits), peas, all cucurbits, grapes, roses
**Type:** Fungal (obligate parasite — Ascomycetes)
**Season/Conditions:** Dry weather with moderate temperature (20-28°C) and moderate humidity (50-80%). Unlike most fungi, powdery mildew does NOT need free water for infection — thrives in dry conditions with heavy dew. In India, most severe during Rabi season (Nov-Feb) and again in late Kharif when nights become cooler.

**Symptoms:**
- **Chilli/Brinjal:** White to greyish powdery coating on upper and lower leaf surfaces. Starts as small circular patches, spreads to cover entire leaf. Severely infected leaves curl upward, turn yellow-brown, and fall prematurely. Flower drop and reduced fruit set. Fruit quality affected.
- **Mango:** White powdery growth on flower panicles, young fruits, and tender leaves. Infected flowers fail to set fruit — premature flower and fruit drop (most economically damaging). Can cause 50-80% yield loss in severe attacks.
- **Cucurbits:** White powder on upper leaf surface, stems, and sometimes fruits. Older leaves affected first. Leaves yellow, dry, and die. Reduces photosynthesis → smaller fruits, shorter harvest period.
- **General:** Characteristic white talcum-powder-like coating that can be wiped off with finger. Infected tissues have a musty odour.

**Economic Impact:** Chilli powdery mildew causes 20-40% yield loss in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Telangana. Mango powdery mildew is the most important flowering disease — causes ₹2,000-4,000 crore annual loss nationally. Pea PM causes 25-50% loss in northern India.

**Organic/Traditional Treatment:**
- Spray wettable sulphur 80 WP @ 3 g/L (sulphur is accepted in organic farming) — most effective and cheapest
- Spray potassium bicarbonate @ 5 g/L + liquid soap (0.5 mL/L as spreader) — disrupts fungal cell walls
- Neem oil 2% spray at 10-day intervals
- Milk spray — 1 part milk: 9 parts water sprayed weekly (protein acts as antifungal — proven in trials)
- Apply Ampelomyces quisqualis (mycoparasite of powdery mildew) — available commercially as "AQ-10"
- Improve air circulation — proper spacing, pruning in mango orchards

**Chemical Treatment:**
- **Best option:** Dinocap 48 EC (Karathane) @ 1 mL/L — specific for powdery mildew
- **Systemic:** Hexaconazole 5 EC @ 1.5 mL/L or Myclobutanil 10 WP @ 1 g/L
- **Broad-spectrum:** Carbendazim 50 WP @ 1 g/L
- **Combination:** Azoxystrobin 23 SC @ 1 mL/L (strobilurin — excellent for powdery mildew)
- **For mango:** Spray Wettable Sulphur 0.2% at panicle emergence (first spray) + Hexaconazole 5 EC @ 2 mL/L at full bloom (second spray). 2 sprays at 15-day interval usually sufficient.
- **For chilli:** Start spraying at first appearance. 3-4 sprays at 10-day intervals.

**Prevention:**
- Resistant varieties: For chilli — Arka Lohit, Arka Suphal; For mango — Neelum (moderately resistant); For peas — Arkel, Azad P-1 (tolerant)
- Avoid excessive nitrogen — promotes succulent growth susceptible to PM
- Prune mango trees to open canopy — improves air flow
- Remove and destroy severely infected plant parts
- In greenhouses: maintain humidity <60%, improve ventilation

### A10. Anthracnose (Mango, Chilli, Banana, Papaya)

**Scientific Name:** Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (Mango, Banana, Papaya), Colletotrichum capsici (Chilli — also known as "die-back and fruit rot of chilli")
**Crop Affected:** Mango (fruits + leaves), Chilli (fruits + stems — "die-back"), Banana (post-harvest), Papaya (fruits), Grapes, Pomegranate, Citrus
**Type:** Fungal (Ascomycetes — causes both pre-harvest and post-harvest diseases)
**Season/Conditions:** Warm (25-30°C) and wet/humid conditions (>80% RH). Rain splash is the primary mode of spore dispersal. Most severe during monsoon (Jul-Sep) and in areas with heavy dew. Fungus survives on dead twigs, leaf litter, and mummified fruits.

**Symptoms:**
- **Mango:** Black/dark brown, irregular spots on fruits — spots merge and form large sunken lesions. Flesh beneath turns dark and soft. On leaves: irregular brown spots with yellow halo. On panicles: blackening of flower stalks, flower drop. Post-harvest: fruits develop black spots during ripening and transit — major cause of market rejection.
- **Chilli (Die-back + Fruit rot):** "Die-back" starts from growing tip — twig dries from top downward. Concentric ring-like sunken lesions on ripe fruits. Fruits shrivel and dry on plant ("mummification"). Seeds become non-viable. Die-back + fruit rot together can destroy 50-80% of chilli crop.
- **Banana:** Dark brown/black sunken spots on ripening fruit skin. Develops mainly during transit and storage. Fingers blacken at tips.
- **Papaya:** Dark, water-soaked spots on fruits that enlarge to form sunken, circular lesions with pink/orange spore mass in centre.

**Economic Impact:** Anthracnose is the #1 post-harvest disease of mango in India — causes 10-40% post-harvest losses (before reaching consumer). Chilli anthracnose/die-back causes ₹1,000-3,000 crore annual loss. Banana anthracnose causes 5-15% rejection at market.

**Organic/Traditional Treatment:**
- Spray Pseudomonas fluorescens @ 10 g/L starting at flowering stage, repeat every 10 days
- Trichoderma viride @ 5 g/L as preventive foliar spray
- Bordeaux mixture 1% spray on mango panicles at flowering and marble stage
- Hot water treatment of mango fruits: Dip in 52°C water for 5 minutes post-harvest — kills surface spores without damaging fruit
- Neem oil 2% spray on chilli during fruiting stage

**Chemical Treatment:**
- **Preventive:** Mancozeb 75 WP @ 2.5 g/L — spray starting at flowering, repeat every 10-12 days
- **Curative:** Carbendazim 50 WP @ 1 g/L or Thiophanate-methyl 70 WP @ 1 g/L
- **Best systemic option:** Azoxystrobin 23 SC @ 1 mL/L (excellent against Colletotrichum)
- **For mango:** Spray Carbendazim 1 g/L at flowering + fruit set + 15 days before harvest. Post-harvest dip in Carbendazim 500 ppm for 5 minutes
- **For chilli (die-back):** Spray Copper oxychloride 50 WP @ 3 g/L + Carbendazim 50 WP @ 1 g/L alternately at 10-day intervals. Start at first die-back symptom.
- **Seed treatment (chilli):** Treat seeds with Carbendazim 50 WP @ 2 g/kg or Thiram 75 WP @ 3 g/kg before sowing

**Prevention:**
- Resistant varieties: Mango — Neelum (tolerant); Chilli — Pusa Jwala, Arka Lohit (moderately tolerant)
- Collect and destroy fallen fruits, mummified fruits, and dead twigs (reduce inoculum)
- Prune mango trees after harvest — remove dead wood, open canopy for sunlight and air
- Proper fruit handling — avoid bruising during harvest and transit
- Cold chain maintenance: Store mango at 12-13°C, banana at 13-14°C to slow anthracnose development
- Pre-harvest spray schedule is essential — cannot control anthracnose only with post-harvest treatment

## SECTION B: Major Insect Pests

### B1. Brown Planthopper (BPH) — Rice

**Scientific Name:** Nilaparvata lugens (Stål)
**Crop Affected:** Rice (all varieties, particularly high-yielding IR varieties)
**Type:** Insect pest — Hemiptera (Delphacidae). Sap-sucking insect. Also transmits Rice Grassy Stunt Virus and Rice Ragged Stunt Virus.
**Season/Conditions:** Kharif season, peak during August-October. Thrives at 25-30°C, high humidity (>80%), continuous rainfall, excessive nitrogen application, close spacing, lush green canopy. Population explodes (resurgence) after indiscriminate spraying of synthetic pyrethroids/organophosphates (kills natural enemies).

**Symptoms:**
- **"Hopper burn":** Circular patches of dried, brown plants in field — looks like the field was scorched by fire. Most distinctive symptom visible from field edges.
- **Feeding damage:** Nymphs and adults feed at plant base (just above water line) by sucking phloem sap. Plants turn yellow from bottom, then brown, and die. Heavy infestation — plants collapse.
- **Honeydew:** Sticky, shiny excretion on leaf sheaths and water surface. Sooty mould (black fungus) grows on honeydew.
- **Identification:** Adults are small (4-5 mm), brown, wedge-shaped insects. Found in clusters at stem base. Two forms — short-winged (brachypterous, stays in field) and long-winged (macropterous, migrates).

**Economic Impact:** India's most damaging rice pest after stem borer. Can cause 10-70% yield loss. Entire fields destroyed in severe "hopper burn" outbreaks. Major pest in eastern and southern India — West Bengal, Odisha, AP, Telangana, Tamil Nadu, Kerala.

**Organic/Traditional Treatment:**
- Drain water from field for 3-4 days — BPH populations crash without standing water (most effective cultural control)
- Release Lycosa pseudoannulata (wolf spider) — major natural predator. Avoid broad-spectrum sprays that kill spiders
- Release Cyrtorhinus lividipennis (mirid bug) — predator of BPH eggs
- Spray neem oil 5% or NSKE 5% — acts as repellent and antifeedant
- Apply Metarhizium anisopliae (entomopathogenic fungus) @ 5 g/L — infects and kills BPH

**Chemical Treatment:**
- ⚠️ **DO NOT spray synthetic pyrethroids (cypermethrin, deltamethrin) or organophosphates (monocrotophos, quinalphos)** — these kill natural enemies and cause BPH RESURGENCE (population explosion 10-14 days after spray). This is the #1 mistake Indian rice farmers make.
- **Recommended:** Pymetrozine 50 WG @ 0.6 g/L — selectively kills BPH without harming natural enemies
- **Alternative 1:** Dinotefuran 20 SG @ 0.5 g/L
- **Alternative 2:** Buprofezin 25 SC @ 2 mL/L — insect growth regulator, disrupts moulting
- **Alternative 3:** Thiamethoxam 25 WG @ 0.5 g/L (spray at base, not on canopy)
- **Application method:** Direct spray at plant base where BPH feeds — NOT broadcast spraying
- **ETL (Economic Threshold Level):** 5-10 BPH/hill at tillering, 10-15/hill at flowering. Count by tapping tillers over a white tray.

**Prevention:**
- Resistant varieties: Samba Mahsuri (BPH-resistant), Improved Samba Mahsuri, CO-43 (TN), Jyothi (Kerala)
- Avoid excessive nitrogen (>120 kg/ha) — lush growth attracts BPH
- Maintain recommended spacing (20×15 cm) — avoids dense canopy
- Light traps (mercury vapour) to monitor adult migration — install at field edges
- Conserve natural enemies — spiders, mirid bugs, dragonflies are the best BPH controllers

### B2. Yellow Stem Borer — Rice

**Scientific Name:** Scirpophaga incertulas (Walker)
**Crop Affected:** Rice — most important stem borer species in India
**Type:** Insect pest — Lepidoptera (Pyralidae). Moth lays eggs, larvae bore into stems.
**Season/Conditions:** Active throughout Kharif and Rabi rice seasons. Moth flight peaks at dusk. Females attracted to fields with standing water. Staggered planting dates and continuous rice cultivation provide year-round hosts.

**Symptoms:**
- **"Dead heart" (Vegetative stage):** Central leaf whorl turns brown and dries while outer leaves remain green. Dead heart can be easily pulled out — smooth, rotted base. Occurs when larva bores into growing tiller and feeds inside, killing the growing point.
- **"White ear" / "White head" (Reproductive stage):** Entire panicle turns white — no grain fills. Panicle remains erect (unlike blast where it droops). If pulled, panicle comes out easily with a clean cut at the node. MOST DAMAGING symptom — each white ear = 100% loss of that tiller.
- **Larva identification:** Creamy-white caterpillar (20-25 mm) with yellowish-brown head, found inside hollow stem. Single larva can damage 2-4 tillers by migrating between them.
- **Egg mass:** Flat, oval, covered with buff/brown hairs — found on leaf surface near tip.

**Economic Impact:** India's #1 rice stem borer. Causes 5-25% yield loss annually across all rice-growing states. Severe in eastern India (WB, Bihar, Odisha) and South India. "White ear" damage is irreversible — each white ear means zero grain from that tiller.

**Organic/Traditional Treatment:**
- **Trichogramma japonicum release:** @ 1-1.5 lakh eggs/ha, 6-8 releases at weekly intervals starting from 30 DAT — egg parasitoid, most effective biocontrol for stem borer (70-80% egg parasitization in good releases)
- Install pheromone traps @ 5/acre at transplanting — monitor moth activity and mass-trap males
- Release Telenomus rowani (egg parasitoid) — complements Trichogramma
- Clip and destroy egg masses during field monitoring (visible on leaf surface)
- Raise field bund level to submerge lower portions of stems (kills eggs laid near waterline)
- Stubble management: Cut rice stubble close to ground level, flood field after harvest (drowns pupae)

**Chemical Treatment:**
- **Seed/nursery treatment:** Chlorantraniliprole 0.4% GR @ 10 kg/ha broadcast in nursery
- **Granular application (best):** Cartap hydrochloride 4G @ 25 kg/ha OR Carbofuran 3G @ 25 kg/ha — broadcast in standing water at 30-35 DAT and again at booting
- **Foliar spray:** Chlorantraniliprole 18.5 SC (Coragen) @ 0.3 mL/L — spray at egg-laying peak
- **Alternative spray:** Flubendiamide 480 SC @ 0.25 mL/L
- **ETL:** >5% dead hearts (vegetative) or >2% white ears (reproductive)

**Prevention:**
- Remove and destroy rice stubble after harvest — pupae overwinter in stubble
- Synchronised planting across village — prevents moth migration between fields of different ages
- Avoid late planting — early planted crop escapes peak moth generation
- Clipping leaf tips during transplanting removes eggs (controversial but practiced in some areas)
- Light traps @ 1/5 acres — catch and kill adult moths during peak flight
- Moderately resistant varieties: Ratna, Surekha, Vikas (check state recommendations)

### B3. Whitefly — Cotton, Tomato, Vegetables

**Scientific Name:** Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) — Biotype B (Silverleaf whitefly) and indigenous Indian biotype
**Crop Affected:** Cotton (primary), Tomato, Chilli, Brinjal, Okra, Beans, Cucumber, Papaya. Also transmits Cotton Leaf Curl Virus (CLCuV), Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl Virus (TYLCV), and Geminiviruses.
**Type:** Insect pest — Hemiptera (Aleyrodidae). Tiny sap-sucking insects on leaf underside.
**Season/Conditions:** Year-round in tropical India, peak in warm dry weather (30-40°C, low humidity). Population explodes in October-November in North India cotton belt. Adults are tiny (1-1.5 mm), white, moth-like. Found on leaf underside.

**Symptoms:**
- **Direct damage:** Yellowing and downward curling of leaves. Plants stunted with reduced vigour. Heavy infestation — leaves dry and fall.
- **Honeydew + Sooty mould:** Sticky honeydew excretion on lower leaves. Black sooty mould grows on honeydew — blocks sunlight, reduces photosynthesis. Cotton lint gets sticky ("sticky cotton") — rejected at ginning mills.
- **Cotton Leaf Curl Virus (CLCuV):** Transmitted by whitefly. Leaves curl upward/downward, develop leaf-like outgrowths (enations) on underside of veins, veins thicken. Plant becomes stunted and bushy. 🔴 NO CURE for CLCuV once infected. Devastating in North India — Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan cotton belt.
- **Tomato Yellow Leaf Curl:** Leaves curl upward, turn yellow, plants stunted, flowers drop, no fruit set.

**Economic Impact:** India's #1 cotton pest after bollworm. CLCuV alone caused ₹10,000+ crore losses in 2015-16 North India cotton epidemic. Whitefly-transmitted viruses are now a bigger threat than bollworm in many regions.

**Organic/Traditional Treatment:**
- Yellow sticky traps @ 12/acre — whitefly attracted to yellow colour. Place at canopy height. Replace every 7-10 days.
- Neem oil 2% or Azadirachtin 1500 ppm @ 3 mL/L spray — repels adults and disrupts reproduction
- Spray Beauveria bassiana @ 5 g/L (entomopathogenic fungus) — infects whitefly nymphs
- Spray Verticillium lecanii @ 5 g/L — specific fungal biocontrol for whiteflies
- Grow maize/sorghum border rows (3-4 rows) around cotton field — acts as wind barrier, reduces whitefly migration into field

**Chemical Treatment:**
- ⚠️ **AVOID pyrethroids** — whitefly has developed high resistance. Pyrethroids also kill natural enemies.
- **Recommended:** Diafenthiuron 50 WP @ 1.2 g/L — excellent against all whitefly stages
- **Alternative 1:** Pyriproxyfen 10.8 EC @ 1.5 mL/L — IGR, disrupts nymph development
- **Alternative 2:** Spiromesifen 22.9 SC @ 0.5 mL/L — lipid synthesis inhibitor
- **Alternative 3:** Cyantraniliprole 10.26 OD @ 1.8 mL/L — systemic, new-generation
- **Neonicotinoids:** Imidacloprid 17.8 SL @ 0.3 mL/L or Thiamethoxam 25 WG @ 0.5 g/L — seed treatment or early-season spray only (resistance developing)
- **Spray timing:** Early morning or late evening when adults are sedentary. Direct spray at leaf underside.

**Prevention:**
- CLCuV-tolerant cotton varieties in North India — consult latest ICAR-CICR/State University recommendations
- Seed treatment with Imidacloprid 70 WS @ 7 g/kg seed — protects seedlings for 30-40 days
- Remove and destroy CLCuV-infected plants immediately (rogue within 7 days)
- Avoid summer host plants (bhindi, tomato, brinjal) near cotton fields — whitefly reservoir
- Maintain clean field borders — destroy weed hosts (Abutilon, Sida, Parthenium)

### B4. Aphids — Mustard, Wheat, Vegetables

**Scientific Name:** Lipaphis erysimi (Mustard aphid), Rhopalosiphum padi (Wheat/Oat aphid), Myzus persicae (Green peach aphid — vegetables), Aphis gossypii (Cotton/Melon aphid)
**Crop Affected:** Mustard (most damaging), wheat, vegetables (chilli, capsicum, brinjal, cabbage, cauliflower, potato), cotton, pulses, cucurbits
**Type:** Insect pest — Hemiptera (Aphididae). Tiny soft-bodied sap-suckers. Reproduce explosively — parthenogenesis (no males needed). Also transmit 100+ plant viruses.
**Season/Conditions:** Cool, dry weather — peak in Rabi season (Dec-Feb). Mustard aphid (Lipaphis) appears from mid-December, peaks in January-February. Population declines with rising temperature (>30°C) and rain.

**Symptoms:**
- **Feeding damage:** Colonies of tiny (1-2 mm), soft-bodied, greenish-grey (mustard) or green/brown (vegetables) insects clustered on growing tips, flower buds, underside of young leaves, and pods. Infested leaves curl, crinkle, and turn pale yellow.
- **Honeydew + Sooty mould:** Aphids excrete honeydew — sticky surface + black sooty mould. Reduces photosynthesis.
- **Mustard-specific:** Inflorescence (flower cluster) covered with aphids. Pod formation severely affected. Oil content of seeds reduced. Severe infestation — siliquae (pods) shrivelled with few seeds.
- **Virus transmission:** Green peach aphid (Myzus persicae) transmits Potato Leaf Roll Virus, Potato Virus Y, and many vegetable viruses. Often more damaging through virus transmission than direct feeding.

**Economic Impact:** Mustard aphid is India's #1 mustard pest — causes 35-75% yield loss if uncontrolled. Particularly severe in Rajasthan, UP, Haryana, MP. Aphid-transmitted viruses cause ₹1,000-2,000 crore loss in potato annually.

**Organic/Traditional Treatment:**
- Spray 2% neem oil or NSKE 5% — effective repellent and antifeedant for aphids
- Release ladybird beetles (Coccinella septempunctata) @ 1,000/ha — each ladybird eats 50-80 aphids/day
- Release lacewing (Chrysoperla carnea) larvae @ 1/m² — voracious aphid predator
- Spray liquid soap solution (5 mL liquid soap/L water) — clogs aphid spiracles
- Conserve natural enemies — hover flies (Syrphidae), parasitic wasps (Aphidius spp.) are excellent biocontrol
- Ash/wood ash dusting on mustard inflorescence — traditional practice, desiccates aphids

**Chemical Treatment:**
- **Mustard:** Spray when 50+ aphids/10 cm twig length (ETL). Dimethoate 30 EC @ 1.7 mL/L or Imidacloprid 17.8 SL @ 0.3 mL/L. Single well-timed spray at inflorescence stage usually sufficient.
- **Vegetables:** Thiamethoxam 25 WG @ 0.5 g/L or Acetamiprid 20 SP @ 0.5 g/L
- **Potato (for virus vector control):** Imidacloprid 17.8 SL @ 0.3 mL/L at 30 days and 50 days after planting
- **Avoid:** Over-use of organophosphates — kills beneficial insects. One well-timed spray is better than multiple sprays.
- **Seed treatment:** Imidacloprid 600 FS @ 5 mL/kg mustard seed — provides 30-40 days protection

**Prevention:**
- Early sowing of mustard (before Oct 25 in North India) — crop passes through vulnerable stage before peak aphid season
- Avoid excessive nitrogen — promotes succulent growth attractive to aphids
- Yellow pan traps (filled with water + detergent) @ 10/acre — monitoring and mass trapping
- Resistant varieties: Mustard — RH-749, NRCHB-101, Bio-902 (tolerant)
- Intercrop mustard with chickpea or lentil — breaks pest cycle, provides habitat for natural enemies

### B5. Fall Armyworm (FAW) — Maize (Invasive Pest)

**Scientific Name:** Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith)
**Crop Affected:** Maize (primary host in India), sorghum, rice, sugarcane, pearl millet. Can attack 80+ plant species. Also feeds on cotton, groundnut, tomato, onion.
**Type:** Insect pest — Lepidoptera (Noctuidae). Invasive alien species — first detected in India in May 2018 in Karnataka. Now present in ALL Indian states. Originated from Americas.
**Season/Conditions:** Active year-round in tropical India. Peak during Kharif maize (Jul-Oct). Moth can fly 100+ km in single night. Thrives at 25-33°C. Rapid reproduction — female lays 1,000-2,000 eggs in 10-21 day lifespan. One generation completes in 30-40 days. Multiple overlapping generations per year.

**Symptoms:**
- **Leaf damage (whorl stage):** Ragged, irregular holes in leaves with large amounts of wet frass (excreta) visible in leaf whorl. Windows (translucent patches) on leaves where larva has fed from one side. Growing point (whorl) filled with caterpillars and frass.
- **Larva identification:** Green-brown to dark brown caterpillar up to 35 mm. Key identifying features: (1) Inverted "Y" shaped marking on head capsule, (2) Four dark spots arranged in a square on second-to-last abdominal segment. Cannibalistic — usually one large larva per whorl.
- **Ear/cob damage:** Larvae bore into developing cob, feed on kernels. Entry holes with frass visible. Severe damage if larvae enter ear at silking stage.
- **Seedling damage:** Can cut seedlings at base (like cutworm) — patchy stand in field.

**Economic Impact:** Since 2018 invasion, FAW has become India's #1 maize pest. Causes 15-50% yield loss in Kharif maize. Estimated annual loss: ₹3,000-5,000 crore in maize alone. Unlike other pests, FAW has no natural population regulation in India yet (no coevolved parasitoids/predators).

**Organic/Traditional Treatment:**
- **Sand + lime application:** Mix dry sand with lime (9:1 ratio), apply into leaf whorls @ pinch per plant — desiccates and irritates larvae. Cheap and effective for smallholders.
- Spray Metarhizium rileyi (Nomuraea rileyi) @ 5 g/L — entomopathogenic fungus specific to armyworms. Apply in evening.
- Spray Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki (Bt) @ 2 g/L — effective against young larvae (1st-3rd instar). Apply in whorl targeting evening/early morning.
- Release Trichogramma pretiosum @ 1.5 lakh/ha (8 releases weekly from 7 DAS)
- Release Telenomus remus — egg parasitoid, highly effective against Spodoptera (50,000/ha)
- Apply neem oil 5% or Azadirachtin 1500 ppm @ 5 mL/L into whorls
- **Pheromone traps:** Install FAW-specific lures @ 15/ha for monitoring — spray when moth catches >8/trap/night

**Chemical Treatment:**
- **Whorl application (most effective delivery):** Apply poison bait — Emamectin benzoate 5 SG @ 4 g + 10 kg dry sand/acre — broadcast into whorls. OR spray directly into whorls
- **Spray (young larvae):** Emamectin benzoate 5 SG @ 0.4 g/L (first choice)
- **Alternative 1:** Chlorantraniliprole 18.5 SC (Coragen) @ 0.4 mL/L — safe for natural enemies, long residual
- **Alternative 2:** Spinetoram 11.7 SC @ 0.5 mL/L
- **Alternative 3:** Thiamethoxam 12.6% + Lambda-cyhalothrin 9.5% ZC @ 0.5 mL/L (tank mix)
- **Seed treatment:** Cyantraniliprole 19.8% + Thiamethoxam 19.8% FS @ 6 mL/kg seed — protects seedlings for 20-25 days
- **AVOID:** Indiscriminate spraying of pyrethroids — FAW developing resistance rapidly. Rotate chemical groups.
- **Timing:** Spray/apply in evening (4-6 PM) when larvae are active. Morning spray has poor contact with larvae hiding in whorls.

**Prevention:**
- Early sowing at onset of monsoon — avoids peak FAW buildup
- Intercropping maize with pigeon pea or cowpea — "push-pull" strategy (Napier/Brachiaria grass as trap crop around field, Desmodium as intercrop repels moths)
- Deep summer ploughing — exposes pupae in soil
- Destroy crop residues after harvest — larvae/pupae survive in residues
- Monitor pheromone traps from seedling emergence — early detection allows timely intervention
- Border rows of Napier grass around maize — attracts FAW moths for egg-laying, then destroy heavily infested Napier

### B6. Fruit Fly — Mango, Guava, Cucurbits

**Scientific Name:** Bactrocera dorsalis (Oriental fruit fly — Mango, Guava), Bactrocera cucurbitae (Melon fly — Cucurbits)
**Crop Affected:** Mango (primary), Guava, Sapota, Citrus, Banana (B. dorsalis). Cucumber, Bitter gourd, Pumpkin, Watermelon, Ridge gourd, Snake gourd (B. cucurbitae)
**Type:** Insect pest — Diptera (Tephritidae). Female fly punctures fruit skin with ovipositor, lays eggs inside. Larvae (maggots) feed inside fruit, causing rot.
**Season/Conditions:** Active in warm humid weather (25-35°C). Peak during fruit maturation. Mango fruit fly severe during March-June. Cucurbit fruit fly throughout monsoon (Jul-Oct). Adults live 2-3 months, very mobile — fly several kilometres.

**Symptoms:**
- **Egg-laying punctures:** Small brown dots/dimples on fruit surface (oviposition marks). Often oozing sap.
- **Larval damage:** Maggots (white, legless, 8-10 mm) feed inside fruit flesh. Fruit rots from inside — brown, mushy, fermented smell. External appearance may be normal initially.
- **Fruit drop:** Infested fruits drop prematurely. Dropped mango with soft spots near stem end — typical fruit fly damage.
- **Cucurbit damage:** Fruits become distorted, develop brown rot, maggots visible when fruit cut open. Often secondary bacterial/fungal decay follows.

**Economic Impact:** Fruit fly causes 5-30% mango loss in India (up to 80% in some orchards). ₹2,000-3,000 crore annual loss across mango, guava, cucurbits. Major quarantine pest — prevents fresh mango export to many countries.

**Organic/Traditional Treatment:**
- **Methyl Eugenol traps (MAT — Male Annihilation Technique):** Plywood blocks soaked in Methyl Eugenol + Malathion (ratio 10:1). Hang @ 10/acre in mango orchard. Attracts and kills male flies — disrupts mating. ⭐ MOST effective and economical control method.
- **Bait Application Technique (BAT):** Mix 10 mL protein hydrolysate (or 100 g jaggery) + 1 mL Malathion 50 EC + 1 L water. Spray on 1m² patch on tree trunk or non-fruit part. Flies attracted to protein bait, consume poison. Apply weekly.
- Install fruit fly-specific pheromone traps @ 5-10/acre for monitoring
- Collect and destroy fallen/infested fruits daily — bury 45+ cm deep or submerge in water for 48 hours
- Sanitation: Harvest fruits at proper maturity, don't leave overripe fruits on tree

**Chemical Treatment:**
- **Cover spray (not recommended as primary):** Deltamethrin 2.8 EC @ 1 mL/L or Malathion 50 EC @ 2 mL/L — 2-3 sprays at 15-day intervals during fruit development. Issues: residue on fruit, kills pollinators
- **Soil drenching:** Chlorpyrifos 20 EC @ 5 mL/L drench around tree base — kills pupae in soil
- **Spinosad-based bait:** GF-120 NF (Spinosad 0.02%) — organic-compatible bait spray, reduces need for cover sprays
- **Post-harvest:** Hot water treatment (48°C for 60 minutes) or Vapour Heat Treatment (VHT at 48°C for 20 min) — kills eggs/larvae inside fruit for export quality

**Prevention:**
- MAT traps should be installed 6-8 weeks before fruit maturation (from February for mango)
- Orchard sanitation — remove and destroy wild/unmanaged host trees near orchard
- Harvest fruits at "3/4 mature" stage (firm, not fully ripe) — less attractive to fruit fly
- Paper/cloth bagging of individual mango fruits (from marble stage) — 100% protection but labour-intensive, practiced for export-grade mangoes
- Deep ploughing around tree canopy in summer — exposes pupae in soil

### B7. Red Palm Weevil — Coconut, Oil Palm, Date Palm

**Scientific Name:** Rhynchophorus ferrugineus (Olivier)
**Crop Affected:** Coconut (primary in India), Oil palm, Date palm, Arecanut, Sago palm
**Type:** Insect pest — Coleoptera (Curculionidae). Grub (larva) bores into trunk and crown, feeds internally.
**Season/Conditions:** Active year-round in tropical India. Adults fly and colonize palms mainly during monsoon (Jun-Sep) and post-monsoon. Female lays 200-300 eggs in wounds/cut surfaces on trunk. Larval development inside trunk takes 2-3 months.

**Symptoms:**
- **Early signs:** Small holes (1-2 cm) on trunk with brown fibrous frass oozing out. Chewed fibre material near crown base.
- **Crown symptoms:** Central unopened leaves (spindle) wilt, turn yellow, and droop. Crown becomes lopsided as inner tissues are destroyed.
- **Advanced stage:** Central crown collapses ("toppling of crown"). Fermented toddy-like smell from trunk. Gnawing sound audible if ear placed on trunk.
- **Fatal:** By the time external symptoms are clearly visible, 60-70% internal damage is done. Adult palm can die within 6-12 months of infestation.

**Economic Impact:** Most destructive pest of coconut worldwide. Kills palms permanently — coconut palm takes 6-8 years to start bearing. India loses an estimated ₹500-1,000 crore annually. Severe in Kerala, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Goa.

**Organic/Traditional Treatment:**
- **Pheromone traps:** Ferrugineol-based aggregation pheromone traps (bucket type) @ 1/hectare. Most effective mass-trapping tool — can trap 100+ adults/trap/month. Attract adults from 500m radius.
- Inject Metarhizium anisopliae (entomopathogenic fungus) suspension into trunk holes
- Apply Beauveria bassiana paste on wounds and cut surfaces
- Stem injection with neem oil (10%) through holes drilled into infested trunk
- Regular crown cleaning — remove dried leaves and fibre that harbour adult weevils

**Chemical Treatment:**
- **Trunk injection (curative):** Drill 2-3 holes (downward angle) into trunk near infestation zone. Inject Imidacloprid 17.8 SL (10 mL in 10 mL water) per hole OR Chlorpyrifos 20 EC (10 mL per hole). Seal holes with cement.
- **Crown treatment:** Pour Chlorpyrifos 20 EC @ 5 mL/L (1-2 L/palm) into leaf axils and crown area — preventive monthly treatment in endemic areas
- **Wound treatment:** Apply Carbaryl 50 WP paste (50 g + 1 L water) on all trunk wounds, cut surfaces, and leaf scars — prevents egg-laying
- **Soil drenching:** Imidacloprid 17.8 SL @ 3 mL/L — drench around palm base to kill emerging adults

**Prevention:**
- **NEVER leave open wounds on palm trunk** — dress all cuts immediately with Bordeaux paste or Carbaryl paste. RPW females lay eggs in wounds/cuts.
- Avoid cutting green leaves/fronds (creates wounds)
- Install pheromone traps year-round for early detection
- If palm is severely damaged (crown collapsed) — fell and burn immediately to prevent adults from emerging and spreading
- Fill leaf axils with sand + neem cake (1:1) as physical barrier
- Regular monitoring — inspect palms monthly for holes, frass, smell

### B8. Rhinoceros Beetle — Coconut, Oil Palm

**Scientific Name:** Oryctes rhinoceros (Linnaeus)
**Crop Affected:** Coconut (primary), Oil palm, Arecanut, Date palm
**Type:** Insect pest — Coleoptera (Scarabaeidae). Large black beetle (35-50 mm), horn on head (male). Adults bore into unopened leaves and crown.
**Season/Conditions:** Active year-round, peak during pre-monsoon (Apr-Jun) and post-monsoon (Oct-Nov). Adults active at night — fly from breeding sites (decaying organic matter) to palm crowns. Larvae (white grubs) develop in compost pits, manure heaps, decaying coconut logs, sawdust piles — any decaying organic material.

**Symptoms:**
- **Leaf damage:** Characteristic "V-shaped" or triangular cuts on frond edges — looks like someone cut leaf with scissors. Young unopened leaves (spindle) show diamond/wedge-shaped holes when they unfurl.
- **Crown boring:** Adult beetle bores into base of spindle/unopened leaf. Bore hole (2-3 cm diameter) visible at crown centre with chewed fibre at entry. Beetle feeds on soft tissue inside.
- **Yield reduction:** Repeated damage to growing point reduces number of functional fronds → reduced nut yield. Does not usually kill palm (unlike RPW) but weakens it.
- **Secondary damage:** Bore holes created by rhinoceros beetle serve as entry points for Red Palm Weevil (RPW) — this combination is lethal. Control rhinoceros beetle to prevent RPW invasion.

**Economic Impact:** Ubiquitous pest of coconut in India. Causes 10-15% yield reduction in endemic areas. More importantly, its bore holes invite RPW, making rhinoceros beetle control essential for preventing RPW attacks.

**Organic/Traditional Treatment:**
- **Metarhizium anisopliae (Green Muscardine Fungus):** Mix 5 kg M. anisopliae-colonized rice bran in breeding sites (manure/compost heaps) — infects and kills larvae. ⭐ MOST effective biocontrol.
- **Oryctes rhinoceros Nudivirus (OrNV):** Virus specific to rhinoceros beetle — release infected beetles (0.5 mL virus suspension fed to 30 adults, release in field) — spreads through population. Available from ICAR-CPCRI.
- Install rhinoceros beetle pheromone traps (Oryctalure) @ 5/ha — mass trapping of adults
- Leaf axil filling: Pack top 3 leaf axils with sand + naphthalene balls (2-3 per axil) or neem cake
- Hook out beetles: Check crown monthly — use hooked iron rod to extract beetles from bore holes

**Chemical Treatment:**
- **Crown treatment (preventive):** Pour Chlorpyrifos 20 EC @ 5 mL/L (1 L/palm) OR Carbaryl 50 WP 2% (20 g/L) into top 3 leaf axils at monthly intervals
- **Bore hole treatment:** Insert Aluminum Phosphide tablet (Celphos) 1/4 tablet into bore hole, seal with mud — fumigant kills beetle inside
- **Breeding site treatment:** Spray Chlorpyrifos 20 EC @ 5 mL/L on manure/compost heaps to kill larvae
- **Naphthalene balls:** Place 3-4 naphthalene balls in top 3 leaf axils at 45-day intervals — repels adults (widely practiced in Kerala and Karnataka)

**Prevention:**
- **Breeding site management (MOST important):** Do NOT leave decaying coconut logs, trunks, or organic debris unattended — these are prime breeding sites. Chop and burn dead coconut logs. Treat manure/compost heaps with Metarhizium before monsoon.
- Maintain clean plantation floor — remove fallen organic matter regularly
- If using FYM/compost, add Metarhizium or Beauveria formulation before application
- Cover compost pits with soil layer (30 cm) — prevents beetle oviposition
- Regular pheromone trapping from March (before peak flight)

### B9. Brinjal Shoot and Fruit Borer (BSFB)

**Scientific Name:** Leucinodes orbonalis (Guenée)
**Crop Affected:** Brinjal (eggplant/aubergine) — most destructive pest of brinjal in India and South Asia
**Type:** Insect pest — Lepidoptera (Pyralidae). Moth lays eggs on plant, larvae bore into shoots and fruits.
**Season/Conditions:** Active throughout the brinjal growing season (year-round in tropical India). Peak infestation during warm humid months (Jul-Oct and Feb-Apr). Moth is nocturnal — tiny (20 mm wingspan), white with brown spots.

**Symptoms:**
- **Shoot damage (vegetative stage):** Larva bores into growing tips — shoot wilts, droops, and dries. "Dead heart" in shoots visible as wilted terminal portion. Entry hole at base of shoot with frass.
- **Fruit damage (reproductive stage):** Larva bores into developing fruit — entry hole visible with frass at entrance. Fruit flesh tunnelled, brown discolouration inside. Exit holes when larva moves to next fruit. Infested fruits unmarketable — consumer rejects upon seeing bore holes.
- **Frass:** Brown caterpillar excreta visible at bore holes — distinctive identification sign.
- **Larva:** Pink to white caterpillar (15-18 mm), found inside fruit upon cutting.
- **Severity:** In unprotected crop, 50-70% fruits are bored. Some farmers spray 40-80 times per season to control BSFB — major pesticide abuse issue in Indian brinjal cultivation.

**Economic Impact:** Causes 50-70% fruit damage if unchecked. Farmers often spend ₹10,000-15,000/acre on insecticides for BSFB alone. Due to excessive spraying, brinjal has the highest pesticide residue among Indian vegetables — food safety concern.

**Organic/Traditional Treatment:**
- **Pheromone traps:** Install BSFB pheromone (lure) traps @ 15-20/acre. Replace lures every 21 days. Mass-trapping reduces mating — proven to reduce damage by 40-50% alone.
- **Clipping infested shoots:** Inspect plants weekly. Cut and destroy infested (wilted) shoots 5 cm below wilting point — removes larvae before they pupate. ⭐ Essential cultural practice.
- Remove and destroy bored fruits immediately — do NOT leave on plant or throw in field
- Spray Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) @ 2 g/L at weekly intervals from flowering
- Release Trichogramma chilonis @ 1.5 lakh/ha at fortnightly intervals from flowering
- Spray neem oil 2% or NSKE 5% at 10-day intervals — antifeedant effect on larvae
- Grow African marigold as border/intercrop — repels BSFB moths

**Chemical Treatment:**
- **Spray timing is critical:** Spray at 50% flower initiation and repeat every 10-14 days during fruiting. Once larva enters fruit, no insecticide can reach it — must target eggs and neonate larvae.
- **Recommended:** Emamectin benzoate 5 SG @ 0.4 g/L — highly effective, low residue, 3-day PHI (Pre-Harvest Interval)
- **Alternative 1:** Chlorantraniliprole 18.5 SC @ 0.3 mL/L — excellent, safe for pollinators
- **Alternative 2:** Spinosad 45 SC @ 0.3 mL/L — Bt-derived, short PHI
- **AVOID:** Cypermethrin, profenofos, and other organophosphates — persistent residues, unsafe for consumer. Government testing regularly flags brinjal for high residues.
- **PHI (Pre-Harvest Interval):** Wait at least 3-5 days after last spray before harvesting fruit for sale. Ensure food safety.

**Prevention:**
- Use pheromone traps from transplanting — non-negotiable IPM component
- Healthy nursery practices — pest-free seedlings
- Clip and destroy infested shoots every week (cultural control reduces carryover)
- Summer ploughing after final harvest — exposes pupae
- Crop rotation: Avoid brinjal in same plot for consecutive seasons
- Collection and destruction of crop residues after final harvest

### B10. Termites — Sugarcane, Wheat, Groundnut

**Scientific Name:** Odontotermes obesus (Indian mound-building termite), Microtermes obesi (subterranean termite)
**Crop Affected:** Sugarcane (most severe), Wheat, Groundnut, Cotton, Maize, Pulses, Trees, Orchards — nearly all crops in semi-arid and dry regions
**Type:** Insect pest — Isoptera (Termitidae). Social insects living in underground colonies. Damage roots and lower stem by feeding on cellulose.
**Season/Conditions:** Year-round, but damage peaks in dry periods when soil moisture is low (Oct-Feb in North India, Apr-Jun in South India). Colonies in soil — termitaria (mounds) visible in fields. Sandy and sandy-loam soils most affected. Organic matter-deficient soils have higher termite incidence.

**Symptoms:**
- **Sugarcane:** Setts (planting material) hollowed out — poor germination. Roots and lower stem gnawed — plant dries up. Galleries (mud tubes) visible on stem surface. Dead tillers in patches — pull plant and see hollow/eaten root system.
- **Wheat:** Patchy dead plants in field. Roots completely eaten — plant dries and turns white. Pull out — no roots, only muddy galleries. Damage often in pre-sowing/post-sowing dry period.
- **Groundnut:** Pods and taproot eaten. Pods have mud-filled cavities — no kernels. Above-ground plant may look healthy initially until root damage is severe.
- **Trees/Orchards:** Mud tubes running up trunk. Bark eaten from inside. Young trees killed — saplings particularly vulnerable.
- **General indicator:** Mud tubes/galleries (earthen tunnels) on soil surface, crop residues, or stem base — classic termite sign.

**Economic Impact:** Causes 10-30% cane loss in sugarcane, 20-40% yield loss in wheat (in endemic areas of Rajasthan, MP, Maharashtra), 15-25% pod damage in groundnut. Total annual loss estimated at ₹3,000-5,000 crore across crops. Particularly severe in dryland/rain-fed agriculture.

**Organic/Traditional Treatment:**
- Apply Beauveria bassiana @ 2.5 kg/ha mixed with FYM — broadcast before sowing and incorporate in soil
- Apply neem cake @ 250 kg/ha at sowing — antifeedant and repellent
- Flood irrigate before sowing (where possible) — drowns termite galleries
- Remove and destroy termite mounds (termitaria) in and around field — reduces colony source
- Apply castor cake or mustard cake @ 200 kg/ha — traditional practice, produces compounds toxic to termites
- Avoid burning crop residues — incorporate residues in soil with ploughing (provides alternative food, diverts termites from crop)

**Chemical Treatment:**
- **Seed/Sett treatment (preventive — most effective):** Treat sugarcane setts by dipping in Chlorpyrifos 20 EC @ 5 mL/L for 15 minutes before planting. For wheat: Chlorpyrifos 20 EC @ 4 mL/kg seed treatment.
- **Soil application:** Fipronil 0.3% GR @ 20-25 kg/ha — broadcast and incorporate in soil at sowing. ⭐ Most effective chemical for termites.
- **Alternative soil application:** Chlorpyrifos 20 EC @ 4 L/ha — mix with 50 kg sand, broadcast and irrigate
- **Standing crop treatment (emergency):** Drench Chlorpyrifos 20 EC @ 4 mL/L around affected plants — irrigate immediately after
- **Mound treatment:** Pour Chlorpyrifos 20 EC @ 10 mL/L into termite mound holes (200-500 mL per mound). Or inject Aluminum Phosphide (1-2 tablets) into mound and seal.
- **For trees:** Remove mud tubes, apply Chlorpyrifos paste (20 EC + soil) on trunk. Soil drench around root zone.

**Prevention:**
- Deep summer ploughing — exposes termite galleries and queen chamber to sun
- Maintain soil moisture through timely irrigation — termites prefer dry soil
- Apply FYM/compost regularly — improves soil biology, suppresses termites
- Avoid continuous wheat-wheat or wheat-fallow cropping in termite-endemic areas — rotate with crops less susceptible (rice in Kharif)
- Remove old tree stumps and woody residues from field — these are termite food sources
- Treated seed/sett is the single most cost-effective preventive measure

## SECTION D: Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Quick Reference

### IPM Principles for Indian Farming

> **What is IPM?** Integrated Pest Management is a science-based approach that combines multiple pest control methods to keep pest damage below economic injury levels while minimizing risks to human health and the environment. India's NCIPM (National Centre for Integrated Pest Management) promotes IPM as the national strategy for sustainable pest management.

1. **Cultural Control (Foundation — costs ₹0):**
   - **Crop rotation:** Rotate cereals with legumes (rice-chickpea, wheat-green gram). Breaks pest/disease cycles. Example: Rice-rice system promotes BPH/stem borer buildup; rice-pulse rotation breaks it.
   - **Resistant/tolerant varieties:** Use ICAR/SAU-recommended resistant varieties for your region. Examples: Samba Mahsuri (BPH-resistant rice), HD-3226 (rust-resistant wheat), Bt cotton (bollworm), RH-749 (aphid-tolerant mustard).
   - **Optimal sowing time:** Early sowing of mustard (before Oct 25) escapes aphid peak. Timely rice transplanting avoids stem borer peak.
   - **Clean cultivation:** Remove crop residues, weed hosts, volunteer plants. Destroy ratoon rice/stubble — harbours stem borer pupae.
   - **Proper spacing and nutrition:** Avoid excess nitrogen (attracts sucking pests). Maintain recommended spacing (avoids dense canopy favoured by BPH, blast).
   - **Trap cropping:** Marigold borders in tomato/brinjal (repels whitefly). Napier grass border around maize (traps FAW). Mustard border around cabbage (attracts diamondback moth away from crop).
   - **Deep summer ploughing:** Exposes soil-borne pests (pupae, grubs, termites) to sun, predators, and desiccation. Practice in April-May during fallow.

2. **Biological Control (Nature's army — low cost, high sustainability):**
   - **Egg parasitoids:** Trichogramma chilonis/japonicum (stem borer, bollworm), Telenomus remus (FAW)
   - **Larval/pupal parasitoids:** Cotesia flavipes (sugarcane stem borer), Bracon hebetor (pod borer)
   - **Predators:** Coccinellid beetles (ladybirds — aphids), Chrysoperla carnea (lacewing — aphids, whitefly, mealybug), Cryptolaemus montrouzieri (mealybug), spiders (BPH in rice)
   - **Microbial biocontrol:** Trichoderma viride/harzianum (soil-borne fungi), Pseudomonas fluorescens (wilt, blast), Bacillus thuringiensis (caterpillars), Metarhizium anisopliae (white grub, rhinoceros beetle, BPH), Beauveria bassiana (whitefly, aphid, termite), NPV (Helicoverpa, Spodoptera)
   - **Mass production:** Available from ICAR-NBAIR Bengaluru, State Biocontrol Labs, KVKs, and registered private producers. Cost: ₹100-300/acre per release.
   - **Key success factor:** AVOID broad-spectrum chemical sprays (pyrethroids, organophosphates) that kill natural enemies. Use selective insecticides (Emamectin benzoate, Chlorantraniliprole) compatible with biocontrol.

3. **Mechanical/Physical Control (Labour-intensive but effective for smallholders):**
   - **Pheromone traps:** Species-specific lures — FAW, Helicoverpa, stem borer, fruit fly, pink bollworm, BSFB, rhinoceros beetle. Install @ 5-15/acre. Replace lures every 21-30 days.
   - **Light traps:** Mercury vapour or LED light traps — attract nocturnal moths (stem borer, armyworm, Helicoverpa). Install @ 1/5 acre. Operate 6 PM-10 PM. Best for mass trapping and monitoring.
   - **Yellow sticky traps:** Attract whitefly, aphids, leaf miners. Install @ 10-12/acre at canopy height. Replace every 7-10 days.
   - **Blue sticky traps:** Attract thrips. Use in onion, chilli fields.
   - **Hand-picking:** Collect and destroy egg masses (stem borer), infested fruits (brinjal borer), larvae (FAW from whorls). Effective in small plots.
   - **Clipping:** Clip rice seedling tips during transplanting (removes stem borer eggs). Clip infested brinjal shoots weekly.
   - **Bird perches:** T-shaped wooden perches @ 20/acre — attracts insectivorous birds (kingfisher, drongo, myna) that eat caterpillars. ⭐ MOST cost-effective and underutilised tool.
   - **Netting/bagging:** Insect-proof net houses for nurseries. Fruit bagging for mango (fruit fly protection). Net covers for vegetable beds.

4. **Chemical Control (Last resort — use only when ETL is crossed):**
   - **Economic Threshold Level (ETL):** Spray ONLY when pest population exceeds ETL — the pest density at which control cost equals the value of crop saved. Spraying below ETL wastes money and kills natural enemies.
   - **ETL examples:** BPH: 5-10/hill (tillering), 10-15/hill (flowering). Stem borer: >5% dead hearts or >2% white ears. Mustard aphid: >50 aphids/10 cm twig. FAW: >10% infested plants at whorl stage. Helicoverpa: >1 larva/m row in chickpea.
   - **Insecticide rotation:** Rotate chemical groups (MoA groups) every spray to prevent resistance. Never spray same chemical group twice consecutively. Example rotation: Spray 1 = Diamide (Chlorantraniliprole), Spray 2 = Spinosyn (Spinosad), Spray 3 = Avermectin (Emamectin).
   - **Selective insecticides preferred:** Use target-specific chemicals that spare natural enemies. Avoid broad-spectrum pyrethroids and organophosphates as first choice.
   - **Safe practices:** Wear protective gear (mask, gloves, full clothing). Follow label dosage exactly — more ≠ better. Observe PHI (Pre-Harvest Interval) — do not harvest within PHI period. Dispose empty containers safely (triple rinse, puncture). Never spray near water bodies.
   - **CIB&RC registration:** Use ONLY CIB&RC (Central Insecticides Board) registered products. Check label for crop-wise approval.

### Quick Decision Guide: When to Use What

```
IF pest just appeared (below ETL):
  → Install pheromone traps + yellow/blue sticky traps
  → Release natural enemies (Trichogramma, Chrysoperla)
  → Spray neem oil / NSKE 5%
  → Cultural practices (clipping, hand-picking)

IF pest at ETL:
  → Spray Bt / NPV / Beauveria (biocontrol spray)
  → If biocontrol insufficient → selective insecticide (Emamectin, Chlorantraniliprole)
  → Continue monitoring every 3-5 days

IF pest above ETL (outbreak):
  → Selective chemical spray (follow label dose)
  → Re-spray after 10-14 days if needed (rotate chemical group)
  → DO NOT panic-spray pyrethroids — kills natural enemies, causes resurgence
  → Consult KVK/Agriculture Officer for specific guidance

ALWAYS:
  → Maintain records of pest levels, sprays, costs
  → Rotate insecticide groups (never repeat same group twice)
  → Observe Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) strictly
  → Protect pollinators — avoid spraying during flowering

## SECTION E: Emerging & Recent Pest Threats (2024-2026)

> These are new, invasive, or re-emerging pests that Indian farmers must watch for. The AI advisory system should flag these proactively based on location and crop.

### E1. Tuta absoluta — South American Tomato Leaf Miner (INVASIVE)

**Scientific Name:** Tuta absoluta (Meyrick, 1917) — Family Gelechiidae
**Also Known As:** South American tomato pinworm, tomato leaf miner
**Crop Affected:** Tomato (primary — up to 100% loss), also potato, brinjal, capsicum, tobacco, and solanaceous weeds (Datura, Solanum nigrum)
**First Detected in India:** 2014 (reported from Pune, Maharashtra). Now present across most tomato-growing states.
**Origin:** South America (Peru, Chile). Spread to Europe (2006), Africa, Middle East, and Asia. As of 2024, present in 80+ countries (FAO).
**Season/Conditions:** Year-round in tropical India. 8-10 generations per year at 30°C. Prefers 14-35°C range. Nocturnal adults — moths disperse by flying between fields at dusk. Completes lifecycle in 26-75 days depending on temperature.

**Symptoms:**
- **Leaf mines:** Larvae create irregular, blotch-shaped mines (transparent, papery galleries) on leaves — visible when held against light. Mines turn brown as tissue dies. Heavy infestation — entire leaf canopy destroyed.
- **Stem and growing point damage:** Larvae bore into stems and growing tips — wilting of terminal shoots.
- **Fruit damage:** Larvae bore into green and ripe fruits — small entry holes (1-2 mm) visible on fruit surface near calyx. Internal tunnelling causes fruit rot. Secondary infections (bacteria, fungi) follow.
- **Frass:** Black frass (excreta) pellets visible inside mines and bore holes.
- **Identification:** Adult moth is small (6-7 mm), silvery-grey with filiform antennae. Larva: greenish to pinkish, up to 8 mm. Pupa: cylindrical, greenish to brown.
- **Distinct from BSFB:** Tuta absoluta causes leaf mines (BSFB does not). Tuta larvae are smaller and greenish (BSFB larvae are pinkish-white).

**Economic Impact:** Can cause 80-100% yield loss in tomato if uncontrolled. Has dramatically increased tomato production costs in India — farmers report spending ₹15,000-20,000/acre on sprays. Rapidly developing insecticide resistance (documented resistance to organophosphates, pyrethroids, spinosad, and diamides in global populations).

**Management (Based on global IPM experience):**
- **Pheromone traps (essential):** Install Tuta absoluta-specific pheromone traps (delta/water traps) @ 20-25/hectare for monitoring + mass trapping. Available from Pheromone companies — Pest Control India, Russell IPM, ISCA Technologies.
- **Biological control:** Release Nesidiocoris tenuis (predatory mirid bug) — feeds on Tuta eggs and larvae on leaves. Spray Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) @ 2 g/L against young larvae (1st-2nd instar). Apply Beauveria bassiana @ 5 g/L as foliar spray.
- **Chemical control (rotate groups strictly):** Emamectin benzoate 5 SG @ 0.4 g/L, Chlorantraniliprole 18.5 SC @ 0.3 mL/L, Cyantraniliprole 10.26 OD @ 1.8 mL/L, Spinosad 45 SC @ 0.3 mL/L. ⚠️ Rotate MoA groups every spray — Tuta develops resistance extremely fast.
- **Cultural control:** Remove and destroy infested plant debris after harvest (do NOT leave in field). Use insect-proof net houses (40-mesh) for nurseries. Avoid planting solanaceous crops consecutively.
- **Azadirachtin (neem):** Shows consistent efficacy even where synthetic insecticide resistance has developed — include in rotation.

### E2. Rugose Spiralling Whitefly — Coconut, Banana, Mango (INVASIVE)

**Scientific Name:** Aleurodicus rugioperculatus Martin (Family: Aleyrodidae)
**First Detected in India:** 2016 (Pollachi, Tamil Nadu — coconut). Now spread to Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Goa.
**Crop Affected:** Coconut (primary host in India), Banana, Mango, Guava, Sapota, Oil palm, Cashew, and 40+ ornamental/shade tree species.
**Origin:** Central America/Belize. Invasive alien species.
**Season/Conditions:** Year-round in humid tropical areas. Peak: post-monsoon (Oct-Jan). Thrives in warm, humid coastal belts.

**Symptoms:**
- **Waxy, white spiralling deposits** on underside of leaves — characteristic spiral/concentric pattern of white waxy flocculent secretion (looks like cotton wool arranged in spirals). Most distinctive identification feature.
- **Sooty mould:** Copious honeydew production → dense black sooty mould on upper surface of lower leaves. Reduces photosynthesis by 30-40%.
- **Nymphs and adults:** Pale yellow nymphs and adults (larger than Bemisia tabaci — 2-3 mm) on leaf underside.
- **In coconut:** Lower fronds heavily infested. Sooty mould makes nuts dirty and reduces market value. Severe infestation — premature nut fall, reduced copra yield.

**Economic Impact:** Caused significant alarm in South Indian coconut belt in 2016-2018. Yield reduction of 10-25% in severely affected coconut palms. However, natural enemies have begun establishing — damage reducing over time in early-invaded areas.

**Management:**
- **Natural enemy conservation (KEY strategy):** Encarsia guadeloupae (aphelinid parasitoid wasp) — arrived naturally and established in India by 2017. Parasitizes 70-80% of whitefly nymphs. Do NOT spray broad-spectrum insecticides — let this natural enemy do its work.
- Release predator Apertochrysa astur (lacewing) — feeds on whitefly nymphs.
- Spray neem oil 0.5% on underside of fronds — mild suppression without harming natural enemies.
- Install yellow sticky traps for monitoring.
- Spray water jet (high-pressure) on lower fronds — dislodges nymphs and wax.
- **Chemical spray NOT recommended as primary control** — disrupts natural enemy establishment. Use only in severe cases: Spiromesifen 22.9 SC @ 0.5 mL/L directed at lower fronds.

### E3. Fusarium Tropical Race 4 (TR4) — Banana (GLOBAL EMERGENCY)

**Scientific Name:** Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. cubense — Tropical Race 4 (Foc TR4)
**First Detected in India:** 2017 (Bihar — in Grand Naine/Cavendish variety). Confirmed by ICAR-NRCB. Also reported from Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat.
**Crop Affected:** Banana — specifically Grand Naine, Robusta, and other Cavendish (AAA) varieties that are resistant to Race 1 but SUSCEPTIBLE to TR4. This threatens India's ₹50,000+ crore banana industry.
**Threat Level:** 🔴 **CRITICAL** — FAO has declared TR4 a global threat to banana production. No fungicide can cure it. No fully resistant commercial Cavendish variety exists yet.

**Symptoms:**
- Identical to Race 1 Panama Wilt — yellowing of lower leaves, leaf collapse, pseudostem splitting, vascular browning on cross-section.
- Key difference: Occurs in CAVENDISH/Grand Naine varieties (which are resistant to Race 1).
- If Grand Naine/Robusta plants show wilt symptoms in an area where Race 1 was not previously a problem — suspect TR4 immediately.

**Management (Containment — no cure):**
- **Immediate reporting:** If TR4 suspected, report to nearest KVK, District Agriculture Officer, or ICAR-NRCB Tiruchirappalli (0431-2618106). Do NOT wait.
- **Quarantine zone:** Establish 5-meter quarantine around infected plant. Restrict entry of people, animals, vehicles, tools.
- **Destroy infected plants:** Inject pseudostem with Glyphosate 10 mL/plant → wait 2 weeks → uproot → chop → treat with quicklime → bury at site (do NOT move soil/plant material). Cover spot with thick polythene sheet.
- **Disinfection:** Disinfect all tools with 2% sodium hypochlorite (bleach) or 2% formalin before and after use in infected area. Footbaths at field entry points.
- **Do NOT:** Move soil, suckers, or planting material from affected area. Do NOT replant banana in affected soil for minimum 5 years.
- **Use tissue culture plants ONLY** — certified disease-free from ICAR/State-accredited labs.
- **Future varieties:** ICAR-NRCB is evaluating TR4-resistant lines. Watch for official releases.

### E4. Desert Locust — Rajasthan, Gujarat, Punjab (Periodic)

**Scientific Name:** Schistocerca gregaria (Forskål)
**Status in India:** Periodic invasive — major swarm events in 2020 (worst in 27 years), smaller events in 2023-2024. India's Locust Warning Organisation (LWO) under PPQS handles monitoring and control.
**Affected Areas:** Rajasthan (primary breeding zone — Thar Desert), Gujarat, Punjab, Haryana, MP, UP, Maharashtra.
**Crop Affected:** ALL standing crops — locust swarms are non-selective. A 1 km² swarm (40 million locusts) can eat the same amount of food in a day as 35,000 people.

**Symptoms:**
- Massive swarms of large (6-8 cm) yellow-green or pink (immature) grasshoppers landing on fields, trees, vegetation.
- Complete defoliation of all green vegetation within hours.
- Gregarious hopper bands on ground (immature nymphs marching in groups).

**Management:**
- **Government-controlled:** Locust control in India is handled by LWO-PPQS, Jodhpur. Aerial spraying and vehicle-mounted ULV spraying conducted by government teams.
- **Individual farmers:** Report sightings immediately to: **Locust Warning Organisation, Jodhpur — 0291-2651055** or District Agriculture Office.
- Do NOT attempt to spray locusts individually — swarms require coordinated large-area response.
- **Approved chemicals (government use):** Malathion 96% ULV, Chlorpyrifos 50% EC, Lambda-cyhalothrin 5% EC — all applied as Ultra Low Volume (ULV) spray by vehicle/aircraft.
- Traditional: Light fires, beat drums, make loud noise — can deflect small hopper bands but ineffective against large swarms.

### E5. Pink Bollworm — Bt Cotton Resistance Crisis

**Scientific Name:** Pectinophora gossypiella (Saunders)
**Status:** Pink bollworm has developed **field-level resistance to Cry1Ac and Cry2Ab Bt proteins** in BG-II cotton in several Indian states. First documented in Gujarat (2009), now widespread in Maharashtra, Telangana, AP, MP, Karnataka.
**Crop Affected:** Cotton (BG-II Bt hybrids that were supposed to be protected)
**Threat Level:** 🟠 **HIGH** — Undermines the Bt cotton technology that 95% of Indian cotton farmers depend on.

**Symptoms:**
- **Rosette flowers (characteristic):** Petals of cotton flowers are tied together, do not open normally — larva feeds inside closed flower. Most distinctive symptom.
- **Boll damage:** Larva bores into green/mature bolls. Internal feeding destroys lint and seeds. Infested bolls show premature opening with poor lint quality. Pink-coloured larvae (10-12 mm) found inside bolls.
- **Exit holes:** Small round holes on boll surface.

**Management (Beyond Bt):**
- **Mandatory refuge planting:** Plant 20% non-Bt cotton refuge (border rows) as per government requirement — allows susceptible pink bollworm population to survive, slowing resistance evolution.
- **Pheromone traps:** Install Gossyplure (pink bollworm pheromone) traps @ 5/acre from squaring stage. Mass trapping + monitoring.
- **Mating disruption:** Deploy pheromone dispensers @ 200/ha to confuse male moths and prevent mating (emerging technology in India).
- **Short-duration cotton varieties** — harvest early, reduce late-season boll exposure.
- **Spray timing:** Emamectin benzoate 5 SG @ 0.4 g/L OR Chlorantraniliprole 18.5 SC @ 0.3 mL/L at peak egg-laying (monitor with traps).
- **Crop residue destruction (CRITICAL):** After harvest, shred and destroy all cotton stalks before December 31 (many states have mandated this by law). Pink bollworm pupae survive in stalks — destruction is the most effective control for next season.
- **Do NOT keep ratooned cotton** — serves as bridge for pink bollworm carryover.

### E6. Tomato Leaf Curl New Delhi Virus (ToLCNDV) — Expanding Range

**Scientific Name:** Tomato Leaf Curl New Delhi Virus — Begomovirus (Family: Geminiviridae)
**Vector:** Bemisia tabaci (whitefly)
**Crop Affected:** Tomato (primary), Chilli, Capsicum, Cucurbits (new host range expanding). Now also reported on potato, beans, and some ornamentals in India.
**Threat Level:** 🟠 **INCREASING** — Expanding host range and whitefly population growth due to climate change making this more severe.

**Symptoms:**
- **Tomato:** Severe upward leaf curling, puckering, reduced leaf size, yellowing of leaf margins, stunted plant growth. Infected plants produce few/no fruits. Early infection — no harvestable yield.
- **Cucurbits (new):** Severe mosaic, leaf curling, vein yellowing, stunted growth. Reports from North India in melon, cucumber, pumpkin.

**Management:**
- **No cure for viral diseases** — prevent vector (whitefly) and use tolerant varieties.
- Grow ToLCNDV-tolerant tomato hybrids — Arka Rakshak, Arka Samrat (IIHR), TH-1, several private hybrids with Ty-2/Ty-3 resistance genes.
- Whitefly management (see B3 above): Yellow sticky traps, neem oil, Diafenthiuron, Pyriproxyfen.
- Use 40-mesh insect-proof netting on nurseries — prevent early infection of seedlings.
- Rogue infected plants immediately (within 7 days of symptom appearance).
- Reflective silver/aluminium mulch — repels whitefly, reduces virus spread.
- Avoid planting tomato near old cotton/brinjal fields with high whitefly populations.

### First Aid for Pesticide Poisoning

> **EMERGENCY:** Call **108 (Ambulance)** or **112 (Emergency)** immediately. Transport victim to nearest hospital.

**Symptoms of Pesticide Poisoning:**
- Organophosphate/Carbamate: Excessive sweating, salivation, tears, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, pinpoint pupils, muscle twitching, difficulty breathing, confusion, seizures.
- Pyrethroid: Skin tingling/burning, dizziness, headache, nausea.
- Paraquat (banned but still found): Mouth/throat burns, nausea, then liver/lung failure within days. ⚠️ NO ANTIDOTE — must reach hospital immediately.

**First Aid Steps:**
1. **REMOVE** victim from contaminated area to fresh air
2. **REMOVE** contaminated clothing, shoes, accessories
3. **If skin contact:** Wash thoroughly with soap and water (15+ minutes). Do NOT use kerosene/diesel to wash (traditional practice — harmful!)
4. **If eye contact:** Rinse eyes with clean water for 15+ minutes
5. **If swallowed:** Do NOT induce vomiting unless doctor instructs. Give water/milk to drink.
6. **If inhaled:** Move to fresh air, loosen clothing, keep warm
7. **KEEP the pesticide container/label** — take it to the hospital for identification
8. **Hospital treatment:** Atropine is the antidote for OP/Carbamate poisoning. Pralidoxime (2-PAM) for OPs. Activated charcoal for ingestion.

### Safe Pesticide Handling Rules

1. **READ THE LABEL** every time — even if you've used it before. Labels may update.
2. **Wear PPE (Personal Protective Equipment):** Full-sleeve shirt, long trousers, rubber gloves, face mask/respirator, goggles. At minimum: mask + gloves.
3. **Never eat, drink, or smoke while spraying.**
4. **Spray in early morning or late evening** — less wind drift, less heat exposure.
5. **Spray downwind** — never walk into your own spray cloud.
6. **Triple-rinse containers** after use, puncture/crush, and return to dealer or dispose at designated collection point. NEVER reuse pesticide containers for food/water storage.
7. **Store pesticides locked** — away from food, water, children, and animals. Store in original container with label.
8. **Follow dosage exactly** — "double dose for better result" is a myth. It wastes money, harms health, causes residues, and accelerates resistance.
9. **Maintain records** — date, pesticide, dose, target pest, weather. Useful for resistance management and traceability.
10. **Respect PHI** — do not harvest or sell produce until the Pre-Harvest Interval has passed.

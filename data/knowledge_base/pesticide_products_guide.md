**Target Weeds:**
- Broad-spectrum — kills virtually ALL weeds: grasses, broadleaves, sedges
- Effective against Parthenium (Congress grass), Cyperus rotundus (nut grass), Cynodon dactylon (Bermuda grass), Echinochloa (barnyard grass), Sorghum halepense (Johnson grass)
- Perennial weeds — kills roots (unlike contact herbicides)

**Where to Use:**
- Tea and coffee plantations (directed spray between rows)
- Orchards — mango, citrus, coconut, oil palm (directed spray between trees)
- Non-crop areas — railway tracks, industrial sites, channel banks
- Pre-plant weed control — before sowing rice, wheat, vegetables (allow 15 days gap)
- **NEVER** spray directly on any standing crop (will kill the crop)

**Safety & Precautions:**
- **Toxicity:** Slightly toxic (WHO Class III)
- **PHI:** NOT APPLICABLE (should never contact food crop)
- **PPE:** Gloves, mask, goggles, rubber boots
- KILLS ALL PLANTS — extreme care needed to avoid drift
- **Environmental concern:** Potential soil/water contamination — use minimum effective dose
- **Restriction in India:** Glyphosate use is restricted by several Indian states; check local regulations
- **Kerala, Punjab, some others have restrictions** — verify before purchase
- **Do NOT use near water bodies** or in areas with shallow water table

**Alternatives (Selective herbicides):**
- For rice: Pretilachlor, Bispyribac sodium
- For wheat: 2,4-D, Sulfosulfuron
- For sugarcane: Atrazine, Metribuzin
- For cotton: Pendimethalin, Pyrithiobac sodium
- Manual/mechanical weeding (no chemical)

## SECTION 5: Pest Monitoring Tools

### 5.1 Yellow Sticky Traps

**Category:** Pest Monitoring / Mass Trapping (Physical control)
**Type:** Yellow-coloured adhesive traps
**Market Price:** ₹150/pack of 20 pieces (approx. 15×20 cm each)
**No CIB&RC registration required** (non-chemical)

**How it Works:**
- Insects are attracted to yellow colour (phototaxis)
- Sticky adhesive on both sides traps insects on contact
- Used for both monitoring (checking pest population) and mass trapping (reducing population)

**Dosage/Placement:**
- **For monitoring:** 4-5 traps per acre at crop canopy height
- **For mass trapping:** 15-25 traps per acre, evenly distributed
- **Height:** Place at crop canopy level — adjust as crop grows
- **Orientation:** Hang vertically with exposed horizontal sides
- **Replace:** Every 7-14 days (or when surface is full of insects)

**Target Pests:**
- Whiteflies (cotton, tomato, chilli, brinjal — MOST EFFECTIVE)
- Aphids (winged forms — mustard, wheat, vegetables)
- Leaf miners (tomato, citrus)
- Fungus gnats (nurseries, greenhouse)
- Thrips (partially attracted — blue sticky traps are better for thrips)

**Where to Use:**
- Open fields: cotton, tomato, chilli, brinjal, okra, cucumber, all vegetables
- Greenhouses/polyhouses: highly effective in enclosed environments
- Nurseries: monitor and trap early invaders
- Orchards: mango, citrus (for fruit flies — use with attractant)

**Tips:**
- Place traps on upwind side of field for early detection
- Record insect counts weekly — helps decide if chemical spray is needed
- Use with IPM: if trap counts are low, skip chemical spray
- For thrips, use BLUE sticky traps instead of yellow

### 5.2 Pheromone Traps

**Category:** Pest Monitoring / Mass Trapping (Semiochemical control)
**Type:** Funnel/delta traps with species-specific sex pheromone lure
**Market Price:** ₹350/set of 5 traps + lures
**No CIB&RC registration required** (non-chemical)

**How it Works:**
- Synthetic sex pheromone mimics female moth scent
- Male moths are attracted from up to 100-200 metres away
- Males enter trap and are caught — reduces mating success
- Used for MONITORING (to time sprays) and MASS TRAPPING (to reduce population)

**Available Lures (by pest):**
- **Helicoverpa armigera** (Cotton bollworm / Gram pod borer) — most commonly used
- **Spodoptera litura** (Tobacco caterpillar / Common cutworm)
- **Spodoptera frugiperda** (Fall armyworm — FAW)
- **Earias vittella/insulana** (Spotted/spiny bollworm — cotton)
- **Leucinodes orbonalis** (Brinjal shoot and fruit borer)
- **Pectinophora gossypiella** (Pink bollworm — cotton)
- **Bactrocera dorsalis** (Oriental fruit fly — mango, guava) — use methyl eugenol lure
- **Bactrocera cucurbitae** (Melon fruit fly — cucurbits) — use cue-lure

**Placement:**
- **For monitoring:** 5 traps per hectare, placed at crop canopy height
- **For mass trapping:** 15-25 traps per hectare
- **Height for cotton:** 1-1.5 m above ground
- **Height for maize:** At ear level
- **Replace lure:** Every 3-4 weeks (pheromone evaporates)
- **Replace sticky base/water tray:** When full

**How to Use for Spray Decision (ETL-based):**
- If trap catches >8-10 moths per trap per week for Helicoverpa → economic threshold crossed → spray
- If catches are <5 moths per trap per week → no spray needed → save money
- Record counts weekly on a chart — helps predict outbreaks before they happen

**Compatible with IPM:** Yes — combine with bio-pesticides (Bt, NPV, Beauveria), yellow sticky traps, and need-based chemical sprays

## SECTION 7: Safety & Regulatory Quick Reference

### Toxicity Classification (WHO)
- **Class Ia:** Extremely hazardous (RED label) — avoid use
- **Class Ib:** Highly hazardous (RED label) — professional use only
- **Class II:** Moderately hazardous (YELLOW label) — use with full PPE
- **Class III:** Slightly hazardous (BLUE label) — use with basic PPE
- **Class U:** Unlikely to present acute hazard (GREEN label) — safe with basic precautions

### PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) Guidelines
- **Minimum for all pesticides:** Long-sleeved shirt, long trousers, closed shoes, hat
- **For WHO Class II+:** Chemical-resistant gloves, face mask/respirator, goggles, rubber boots
- **After spraying:** Wash hands and face with soap, change clothes, bathe
- **NEVER eat, drink, or smoke** while handling pesticides

### Pre-Harvest Interval (PHI) — Why It Matters
- PHI = minimum days between last spray and harvest
- Harvesting before PHI means pesticide residue in food — health risk to consumers
- ALWAYS follow PHI strictly, especially for vegetables and fruits sold in market
- Green-label products (bio-pesticides) have shortest PHI (0-1 days)

### Banned Pesticides in India (DO NOT USE)
As per PPQS Banned List (revised March 2024):
- Endosulfan, Monocrotophos, Methyl Parathion, Phorate, Triazophos, Alachlor, Dichlorvos (DDVP applied on stored grain), and others
- Check latest CIB&RC list before purchasing any pesticide
- Report sale of banned pesticides to District Agriculture Officer

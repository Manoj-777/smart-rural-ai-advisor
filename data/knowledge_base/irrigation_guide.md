## 2. Irrigation Methods

### 2A. Flood Irrigation (Traditional / Surface Irrigation)

**How it works:** Water is released from a channel or pipe at the top end of a field and allowed to flow across the entire field by gravity. The field is divided into basins, borders, or checks using small bunds. Water spreads uniformly and infiltrates into the soil while flowing across the surface.

**Best for:** Rice (paddy), wheat (in parts of Punjab/Haryana), sugarcane (in Maharashtra/UP). Most widely used method in India — ~78% of irrigated area still uses surface methods.

**Water efficiency:** 30-40% (only 30-40% of applied water is actually used by the plant; 60-70% is lost to deep percolation, evaporation, and runoff).

**Pros:**
- Low initial investment — no equipment needed
- Simple to operate — no technical skill required
- Suitable for heavy clay soils with low infiltration rates
- Works well for crops that need standing water (paddy)

**Cons:**
- Extremely water-wasteful (highest water consumption of all methods)
- Leads to waterlogging, salinity, and nutrient leaching
- Uneven water distribution across field (head vs tail end)
- Promotes weed growth and certain fungal diseases
- Labour intensive — requires constant field supervision

**Water Loss Breakdown:**
| Loss Type | Percentage |
|---|---|
| Deep percolation | 25-35% |
| Evaporation from soil surface | 10-15% |
| Conveyance losses (canal seepage) | 15-25% |
| Runoff | 5-10% |
| Effective water reaching roots | 30-40% |

---

### 2B. Drip Irrigation (Micro-Irrigation)

**How it works:** Water is delivered directly to the root zone of each plant through a network of pipes, valves, tubing, and emitters (drippers). Water drips slowly at a rate of 2-20 litres/hour per emitter, maintaining optimal soil moisture. The system operates at low pressure (0.5-1.5 kg/cm²). Components include: mainline, sub-mainline, laterals (16mm LLDPE pipes), inline/online drippers, filters (screen/disc/sand), and fertigation unit.

**Best for:** Cotton, sugarcane, banana, mango, coconut, pomegranate, grapes, citrus, tomato, chilli, onion, capsicum, all orchard crops, greenhouse crops. Ideal for wide-spaced crops, row crops, and horticultural crops.

**Water efficiency:** 85-95% (highest among all irrigation methods).

**Cost (2025-26 estimates for India):**
| Component | Cost per Acre (₹) |
|---|---|
| Inline drip (vegetable crops, 1.5m spacing) | ₹35,000-50,000 |
| Online drip (orchard crops, 5-6m spacing) | ₹20,000-35,000 |
| Sugarcane subsurface drip | ₹55,000-75,000 |
| Annual maintenance | ₹3,000-5,000 |
| Fertigation unit (venturi/dosing pump) | ₹5,000-15,000 |

**Government subsidy (PMKSY — Per Drop More Crop):**
- **General category farmers:** 55% of total cost
- **SC/ST/Small & Marginal farmers:** 70% of total cost
- **Women farmers:** 70% of total cost
- **How to apply:** Register at state agriculture portal → Submit application with land documents + Aadhaar + bank details → Get approval from district agriculture officer → Purchase system from empanelled vendor → Submit bills for subsidy reimbursement (directly credited to bank via DBT)
- **State portals:** Maharashtra (mahadbt.maharashtra.gov.in), Karnataka (karunadu.karnataka.gov.in), Tamil Nadu (tnagri.gov.in), AP (apagrisnet.gov.in)

**Pros:**
- Saves 40-60% water vs flood irrigation
- Increases yield by 20-50% through precise water delivery
- Enables fertigation (fertilizer + irrigation combined) — saves 25-30% fertilizer cost
- Reduces weed growth by 60-70% (only root zone gets wet)
- Works on all terrains including undulating land
- Reduces labour cost significantly
- Prevents soil erosion and nutrient leaching

**Cons:**
- High initial capital cost
- Emitters can clog (need regular flushing and filtered water)
- Requires regular maintenance (cleaning filters, replacing damaged laterals)
- Not suitable for closely spaced cereal crops (rice, wheat)
- Rodent damage to lateral pipes in some regions
- Requires a pressurized water source

**ROI Analysis:**
| Crop | Extra Yield with Drip (%) | Water Saved (%) | Payback Period |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sugarcane | 25-35% | 40-50% | 1-2 seasons |
| Banana | 30-40% | 45-55% | 1 season |
| Cotton | 20-30% | 35-45% | 2 seasons |
| Tomato | 25-40% | 40-50% | 1 season |
| Pomegranate | 30-45% | 50-60% | 1-2 seasons |
| Mango | 20-30% | 40-50% | 2-3 years |
| Coconut | 25-35% | 45-55% | 2-3 years |

### 2C. Sprinkler Irrigation

**How it works:** Water is sprayed into the air through nozzles under pressure (2-4 kg/cm²), breaking into small droplets that fall on the crop like artificial rainfall. System types include: (a) Portable hand-move sprinklers, (b) Semi-permanent sprinklers, (c) Permanent solid-set sprinklers, (d) Centre pivot systems, (e) Rain gun sprinklers (for large area coverage up to 50m radius).

**Best for:** Wheat, groundnut, pulses, maize, millets, fodder crops, soybean, mustard, potato, vegetables (except tomato during fruiting). Ideal for closely spaced field crops, sandy soils, and undulating terrain.

**Water efficiency:** 65-80% (medium-high).

**Cost (2025-26 estimates):**
| Type | Cost per Acre (₹) |
|---|---|
| Portable sprinkler set (hand-move) | ₹15,000-25,000 |
| Semi-permanent sprinkler | ₹25,000-40,000 |
| Rain gun (single unit, covers 1-2 acres) | ₹30,000-50,000 |
| Micro-sprinkler (for orchards) | ₹25,000-45,000 |
| Annual maintenance | ₹2,000-4,000 |

**Government subsidy (PMKSY):**
- **General category:** 55% of cost
- **SC/ST/Small & Marginal farmers:** 70% of cost
- **Application process:** Same as drip irrigation — apply through state agriculture portal

**Pros:**
- Suitable for all field crops (unlike drip)
- Saves 30-40% water vs flood irrigation
- Uniform water distribution over large areas
- Can apply fertilizers and pesticides through chemigation
- Works well on sandy soils where drip laterals may not be practical
- Portable systems can be moved between fields
- Frost protection capability in winter

**Cons:**
- Higher energy/pressure requirement than drip
- Water loss through wind drift (10-20% on windy days) and evaporation
- Not suitable for tall crops (sugarcane, mature banana)
- Wet foliage promotes fungal diseases if not managed properly
- Requires clean water (large particles cause nozzle blockage)
- Higher operating cost than drip
- Salt burn on foliage if water has high salinity

### 2D. Furrow Irrigation

**How it works:** Water flows along small channels (furrows) dug between crop rows. Furrows are typically 10-30 cm deep and 30-60 cm wide, with spacing matching crop row spacing. Water infiltrates the soil from the sides and bottom of the furrows. Types: (a) Straight furrows (flat land), (b) Contour furrows (sloped land), (c) Corrugation furrows (small, closely spaced), (d) Surge irrigation (alternating furrow flow for better uniformity).

**Best for:** Sugarcane (60-90 cm furrows), cotton, maize, potato, vegetables (tomato, brinjal, chilli, cabbage), all row crops. Very popular in Maharashtra, Gujarat, UP for sugarcane.

**Water efficiency:** 45-60% (better than flood, worse than drip/sprinkler).

**Pros:**
- Lower cost than drip/sprinkler — needs only land shaping
- Keeps plant foliage dry (reduces disease)
- Allows tractor/bullock movement between rows
- Good for heavy clay soils
- Compatible with mechanical cultivation

**Cons:**
- Uneven water distribution (head end gets more than tail end)
- Requires well-levelled land
- Significant deep percolation losses
- Labour intensive for furrow maintenance
- Not suitable for closely spaced crops

**Advanced Technique — Alternate Furrow Irrigation (AFI):**
- Water only every alternate furrow (skip one, irrigate one)
- Saves 25-35% water with only 5-10% yield reduction
- Proven effective in sugarcane (Maharashtra), cotton (Gujarat)
- ICAR recommends AFI for water-scarce regions

### 2E. System of Rice Intensification (SRI)

**How it works:** SRI is a methodology for increasing rice productivity by modifying plant, soil, water, and nutrient management. Key principles: (1) Transplant young seedlings (8-12 days old, 2-leaf stage) instead of 21-25 days old, (2) Plant single seedlings with wider spacing (25cm × 25cm), (3) Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD) — maintain thin layer of water or moist soil instead of continuous flooding, (4) Use mechanical weeder for soil aeration, (5) Apply organic manure along with recommended fertilizers. Fields are kept just moist during vegetative phase and thin water layer (2-3 cm) maintained only during flowering.

**Water savings:** 25-50% reduction compared to conventional flood irrigation. Typical water use: 700-900 mm per crop cycle vs 1200-2000 mm for conventional paddy.

**Yield impact:** 20-50% higher yields reported. National average yield increases from 3.5 t/ha to 5-7 t/ha with SRI. Root development improves by 50-80%, tillering increases by 100-200%.

**Adoption in India:**
- **Widely adopted:** Tamil Nadu (60,000+ ha), Andhra Pradesh (1,00,000+ ha under APCNF), Tripura (leading NE state), Odisha, Bihar, Jharkhand
- **State programs:** Tamil Nadu — SRI promoted through TNAU; Andhra Pradesh — Community Managed Natural Farming integrates SRI; Tripura — state-wide SRI mission
- **Challenges:** Labour-intensive transplanting, weed management requires mechanical weeder, not suitable for all soil types (very sandy or very heavy clay)

**SRI vs Conventional Rice — Head-to-Head Comparison:**
| Parameter | Conventional | SRI Method |
|---|---|---|
| Seedling age | 21-25 days | 8-12 days |
| Seedlings per hill | 3-5 | 1 (single) |
| Spacing | 20×15 cm | 25×25 cm |
| Water management | Continuous flooding | AWD (Alternate Wetting & Drying) |
| Seed rate | 60-80 kg/ha | 5-7 kg/ha |
| Tillers per plant | 8-15 | 25-50 |
| Root depth | 15-20 cm | 25-35 cm |
| Yield | 3.5-5.0 t/ha | 5.0-7.5 t/ha |
| Water used | 1200-2000 mm | 700-900 mm |
| Methane emission | High | 40-60% lower |

## 3. Irrigation Scheduling by Crop Growth Stage

### Rice (Paddy) — Transplanted

| Growth Stage | Days After Transplanting | Water Need | Irrigation Method |
|---|---|---|---|
| Transplanting recovery | 0-15 days | 2-3 cm standing water | Continuous flooding |
| Active tillering | 15-45 days | 5 cm standing water, drain for 2-3 days between irrigations | Intermittent flooding (maintain 3-5 cm, let dry to saturation, re-flood) |
| Panicle initiation | 45-65 days | 5 cm standing water consistently — CRITICAL stage | Continuous flooding — do NOT let field dry. Water stress here reduces panicle size by 30-40% |
| Flowering (Anthesis) | 65-90 days | 5 cm standing water — MOST CRITICAL stage | Continuous flooding. Even 1 day of drought causes 10-15% spikelet sterility |
| Grain filling & maturity | 90-120 days | Gradually reduce — 2-3 cm water, allow intermittent drying | Reduce irrigation frequency. Alternate wetting and drying acceptable |
| Pre-harvest | 10-15 days before harvest | Drain field completely | Stop irrigation. Allows field to dry for combine/manual harvest |

**Total irrigations:** 25-30 (flood), 15-18 (SRI/AWD)
**Rule of thumb:** If soil shows hairline cracks, irrigate within 24 hours during tillering and flowering.

### Wheat — 6 Critical Irrigations (Most Efficient Schedule)

| Irrigation No. | Growth Stage | Days After Sowing (DAS) | Water Depth per Irrigation | Importance Level |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1st | Crown Root Initiation (CRI) | 18-22 DAS | 60-70 mm | 🔴 MOST CRITICAL — missing this irrigation can reduce yield by 40-50% |
| 2nd | Tillering | 38-42 DAS | 50-60 mm | 🟡 Important — promotes tiller formation |
| 3rd | Late Jointing (Stem elongation) | 58-62 DAS | 50-60 mm | 🟡 Important — supports stem growth and ear formation |
| 4th | Flowering (Anthesis) | 78-82 DAS | 60-70 mm | 🔴 CRITICAL — water stress reduces grain number per ear |
| 5th | Milking (Early grain filling) | 98-102 DAS | 50-60 mm | 🟠 High — affects grain size and weight |
| 6th | Dough stage (Late grain filling) | 110-115 DAS | 40-50 mm | 🟢 Moderate — skip this if water is scarce |

**If water is limited (priority order):**
- **Only 1 irrigation available:** Give at CRI stage (18-22 DAS) — Expected yield: 55-65% of potential
- **2 irrigations:** CRI + Flowering — Expected yield: 70-80% of potential
- **3 irrigations:** CRI + Late Jointing + Flowering — Expected yield: 85% of potential
- **4 irrigations:** CRI + Tillering + Flowering + Milking — Expected yield: 90-95% of potential

### Sugarcane — Stage-Wise Irrigation

| Growth Phase | Duration (months) | Water Requirement | Irrigation Interval | Key Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Germination/Sprouting | Month 1-2 | Light, frequent (30-40 mm/irrigation) | Every 7-10 days | Keep soil moist but not waterlogged. Over-watering causes sett rot |
| Tillering | Month 2-4 | Moderate (40-50 mm/irrigation) | Every 10-12 days | Reduce irrigation slightly to encourage root growth |
| Grand Growth | Month 4-8 | HEAVY — peak water demand (50-70 mm/irrigation) | Every 7-10 days | 🔴 MOST CRITICAL phase — 60-65% of total water needed here. Do NOT skip |
| Maturity/Ripening | Month 8-12 | REDUCE sharply (30-40 mm/irrigation) | Every 15-20 days | Withhold water 3-4 weeks before harvest to increase sugar content (brix). Over-watering reduces sucrose recovery |

**Total irrigations per crop cycle:** 28-40 (flood), 365 (drip — daily fertigation)
**Drip fertigation schedule:** 45-60 minutes/day at 3-4 litres/hour/emitter. Saves 40-50% water, increases yield by 25-35%.

### Cotton — Stage-Wise Irrigation

| Growth Stage | Days After Sowing | Water Depth | Irrigation Interval | Key Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Germination-Seedling | 0-25 DAS | Light — 30 mm | Pre-sowing irrigation (rauni), then wait for emergence | Avoid excess water — causes damping off |
| Vegetative/Squaring | 25-55 DAS | 40-50 mm/irrigation | Every 15-20 days | Mild stress is acceptable — promotes root depth |
| Flowering | 55-90 DAS | 50-60 mm/irrigation | Every 10-12 days | 🔴 CRITICAL — water stress causes flower drop and reduced boll set |
| Boll development | 90-130 DAS | 50-60 mm/irrigation | Every 10-12 days | 🔴 CRITICAL — determines boll weight and fibre quality |
| Boll opening/Maturity | 130-170 DAS | Reduce or stop | Every 20-25 days or rain-fed | Excess water delays maturity, promotes boll rot |

**Total irrigations:** 6-8 (rain-fed supplemental), 12-16 (irrigated), continuous (drip)
**Drip schedule for cotton:** 30-45 min/day at 2-4 L/hr emitter spacing 60cm on laterals spaced at 120-150 cm.

### Vegetables — Tomato & Onion

#### Tomato

| Growth Stage | Days After Transplanting | Water Need | Method | Key Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Transplanting-Establishment | 0-15 DAT | Light, frequent — 15-20 mm | Daily or alternate day light irrigation | Water at base — avoid wetting leaves |
| Vegetative growth | 15-40 DAT | 25-30 mm/irrigation | Every 3-4 days | Stake plants, maintain uniform moisture |
| Flowering | 40-65 DAT | 30-35 mm/irrigation | Every 2-3 days | 🔴 CRITICAL — water fluctuations cause flower drop |
| Fruit development | 65-100 DAT | 35-40 mm/irrigation | Every 2-3 days | 🔴 CRITICAL — irregular watering causes blossom end rot and fruit cracking |
| Ripening/Harvest | 100-140 DAT | Reduce — 20-25 mm | Every 4-5 days | Excess water dilutes flavour and promotes rotting |

**Drip schedule:** 30-45 min/day at 2 L/hr, emitter spacing 30-40 cm, lateral spacing 120-150 cm.

#### Onion

| Growth Stage | Days After Transplanting | Water Need | Method | Key Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Transplanting | 0-10 DAT | Light daily watering | Sprinkler or flood | Establish roots |
| Vegetative (Leaf growth) | 10-45 DAT | 25-30 mm/irrigation | Every 5-7 days | Build leaf canopy for photosynthesis |
| Bulb initiation | 45-75 DAT | 30-35 mm/irrigation | Every 4-5 days | 🔴 CRITICAL — moisture essential for bulb formation |
| Bulb enlargement | 75-110 DAT | 35-40 mm/irrigation | Every 3-4 days | 🔴 CRITICAL — determines bulb size. Do not let soil dry |
| Maturity/Neck fall | 110-130 DAT | STOP irrigation | No water — allow tops to fall naturally | ⚠️ Irrigation after neck fall causes rotting in storage. Stop watering 15-20 days before harvest |

**Key onion rule:** Consistent moisture during bulb enlargement + absolute dry period before harvest = best quality + longest storage life.

## 4. Water-Saving Techniques

### 4A. Mulching — Reducing Evaporation from Soil

**What it does:** Covering the soil surface around crops with organic or synthetic material to reduce evaporation, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature.

**Evaporation reduction:** 25-50% less water loss from soil surface.

**Types of Mulch Used in Indian Agriculture:**

| Mulch Type | Material | Cost (₹/acre) | Water Saving | Best For | Duration |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Straw/Paddy stubble | Rice straw, wheat straw | ₹500-1,500 (free if own farm) | 25-35% | Wheat, potato, onion, garlic | 2-3 months |
| Sugarcane trash | Dried sugarcane leaves | ₹0 (own farm waste) | 30-40% | Sugarcane ratoon, inter-row crops | 4-6 months |
| Coconut coir/husk | Coir pith, shell pieces | ₹2,000-4,000 | 30-40% | Coconut, areca, cocoa | 6-12 months |
| Black plastic mulch | LDPE 25-30 micron | ₹4,000-6,000 | 40-60% | Tomato, chilli, capsicum, strawberry, watermelon | 1 season |
| Silver-black plastic | Reflective LDPE | ₹5,000-7,000 | 40-60% | Tomato, chilli (also repels aphids) | 1 season |
| Dry leaves/farm waste | Any available biomass | ₹0-500 | 20-30% | All crops — economical option | 1-2 months |
| Live mulch (cover crop) | Cowpea, horsegram between rows | ₹500-1,000 (seed cost) | 20-35% | Orchards, plantation crops | Continuous |

**Plastic mulch + drip combination:** Saves 50-65% water, increases yield 30-50%, and virtually eliminates weeds. This is the gold standard for vegetable cultivation in India. Government subsidy of 50% available under PMKSY/MIDH for plastic mulch.

### 4B. Rainwater Harvesting — Capturing Every Drop

**Why critical for India:** India receives 1,170 mm average annual rainfall but 80% falls in 4 months (Jun-Sep). Without storage, most water is lost as runoff.

**Farm-Level Rainwater Harvesting Structures:**

#### (a) Farm Pond (Khet Talab)
- **Size:** 20m × 20m × 3m depth (standard) = 1,200 m³ capacity
- **Cost:** ₹50,000-1,50,000 (depending on soil/lining)
- **Lining:** HDPE/silpaulin sheet (₹15-25/m²) to prevent seepage
- **Water available:** Enough for 2-3 supplemental irrigations of 1 acre
- **Government support:** MGNREGA funds available for farm pond digging. Many states (Maharashtra, Rajasthan, MP) provide 50-100% cost support
- **Best for:** Semi-arid regions (Rajasthan, Marathwada, Telangana, Bundelkhand)
- **Scheme:** Jal Shakti Abhiyan, PMKSY Watershed Development

#### (b) Percolation Tank
- **Purpose:** Recharges groundwater — water percolates into soil to raise water table
- **Size:** Community-level — 50m × 50m × 3m
- **Impact:** Raises surrounding well water levels by 1-3 meters
- **Best for:** Hard rock regions (Deccan plateau, Karnataka, AP, Telangana)

#### (c) Contour Bunding & Trenching
- **How:** Small earthen bunds built along land contours to slow runoff and increase infiltration
- **Water captured:** 50-100 mm additional per season in the soil profile
- **Cost:** ₹5,000-10,000/hectare using MGNREGA labour
- **Best for:** Sloping land (>2% slope), red soil regions

#### (d) Rooftop Rainwater Harvesting (for Farm Buildings)
- **Potential:** 1,000 sq ft roof × 1,000 mm rain = 93,000 litres/year
- **Storage:** Underground tank, overhead tank, or recharge well
- **Cost:** ₹15,000-30,000 for basic setup

### 4C. Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD) for Rice — Detailed Protocol

**What:** AWD is a water management technique where rice fields are alternately flooded and allowed to dry to a safe level, instead of continuous flooding.

**Step-by-Step AWD Protocol:**
1. **Install AWD tube:** Place a perforated PVC pipe (15 cm diameter, 25 cm long, holes in lower 15 cm) into the soil — water level inside tube indicates field water level
2. **After transplanting:** Maintain 3-5 cm standing water for first 15 days (establishment)
3. **During tillering (15-45 DAT):** Allow water level to drop to 15 cm below soil surface (check using AWD tube). When water in tube drops to this level, re-irrigate to 5 cm depth
4. **During panicle initiation to flowering (45-90 DAT):** 🔴 Maintain 3-5 cm standing water continuously — NO AWD during this critical period
5. **During grain filling (90-110 DAT):** Resume AWD — allow water to drop to 15 cm below surface before re-irrigating
6. **Pre-harvest (10-15 days before):** Drain completely

**AWD Safe Threshold:** Water level should NEVER drop below 15 cm below soil surface. Below this, the crop experiences stress.

**Results (IRRI/ICAR validated):**
| Parameter | Continuous Flooding | AWD Method | Difference |
|---|---|---|---|
| Water applied | 1400-2000 mm | 800-1200 mm | 30-40% saving |
| Yield | 5.0 t/ha | 4.8-5.2 t/ha | No significant loss |
| Methane emission | 100% (baseline) | 40-50% reduction | Major climate benefit |
| Pumping cost | ₹8,000-12,000/ha | ₹5,000-7,000/ha | ₹3,000-5,000 saved/ha |
| Irrigation count | 25-30 irrigations | 15-18 irrigations | 35-40% fewer pumpings |

### 4D. Deficit Irrigation — Strategic Water Stress

**Concept:** Deliberately under-irrigating crops at specific non-critical stages to save water while minimizing yield loss. The goal is to maximize "crop per drop" — water productivity, not necessarily maximum yield.

**Crops That Tolerate Deficit Irrigation Well:**

| Crop | Tolerant Stage | Apply Deficit (%) | Expected Yield Impact | Water Saved |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Cotton | Vegetative (before flowering) | 30-40% less | -5 to -10% yield | 25-35% |
| Wheat | Tillering stage | 25-30% less | -5 to -8% yield | 20-25% |
| Groundnut | Vegetative (before pegging) | 30% less | -5% yield | 20-30% |
| Maize | Vegetative (before tasseling) | 25-30% less | -5 to -10% yield | 20-30% |
| Millets | Early vegetative | 40-50% less | Minimal impact | 30-40% |
| Sugarcane | Maturity (last 2-3 months) | 40-50% less | Improves sugar content | 25-35% |
| Tomato | Post-fruit set ripening | 20-30% less | Smaller fruit but higher brix | 15-25% |

**Golden Rule:** NEVER apply deficit irrigation during flowering or grain filling stages — these are the most water-sensitive periods for all crops.

### 4E. Scheduling by Soil Type

| Soil Type | Water Holding Capacity | Field Capacity (mm/m) | Wilting Point (mm/m) | Available Water (mm/m) | Irrigation Frequency | Practical Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Sandy | Low | 100-150 | 40-70 | 60-80 | Every 2-3 days (light, frequent) | Water drains fast — use drip irrigation, apply less water more often. Fertigation essential to prevent nutrient leaching |
| Sandy Loam | Medium-Low | 150-200 | 60-90 | 90-110 | Every 4-5 days | Good for most crops. Balance between drainage and retention |
| Clay Loam | High | 250-350 | 120-180 | 130-170 | Every 7-10 days (heavy, less frequent) | Holds water well — risk of waterlogging. Good for rice, wheat |
| Clay | Very High | 350-450 | 180-250 | 170-200 | Every 8-12 days (heavy) | Very slow drainage — avoid over-irrigation. Prone to cracking when dry. Good for paddy, not for root crops |
| Red Soil | Low-Medium | 120-180 | 50-80 | 70-100 | Every 3-5 days | Common in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, AP. Drains well but dries fast. Mulching very beneficial |
| Black Cotton Soil (Vertisol) | Very High (when wet) | 300-450 | 150-220 | 150-230 | Every 8-15 days | Swells when wet, cracks when dry. Self-mulching. Excellent for cotton, soybean, sorghum. Avoid puddling |
| Alluvial | Medium-High | 200-300 | 90-150 | 110-150 | Every 5-8 days | Indo-Gangetic plains. Very fertile. Good for all crops — rice, wheat, sugarcane, vegetables |
| Laterite | Low | 80-140 | 40-60 | 40-80 | Every 2-4 days (frequent, light) | Porous, acidite. Common in Kerala, Goa, coastal Karnataka. Needs frequent irrigation + organic matter to improve retention |

**Soil Moisture Monitoring — Simple Methods for Farmers:**
1. **Feel method:** Take handful of soil from 15 cm depth. Sandy soil — if it doesn't hold shape when squeezed, irrigate. Clay — if it cracks, irrigate. Loam — if it crumbles when squeezed, irrigate.
2. **Stick/Rod method:** Push a 30 cm iron rod into soil. If it goes in easily — adequate moisture. If it meets resistance at 10-15 cm depth — time to irrigate.
3. **Tensiometer:** Instrument placed in soil. Reading >60 centibar = need to irrigate. Cost: ₹800-1,500 per unit.

## 6. Signs of Water Stress in Crops

> The AI can tell farmers to irrigate urgently when they describe these symptoms.

| Crop | Under-watering Signs (Water Deficit Stress) | Over-watering Signs (Waterlogging Stress) |
|---|---|---|
| Rice | Leaf rolling inward (tubular shape) starting from tip, leaves turn pale green then yellowish, reduced tillering, delayed flowering, panicles remain trapped in leaf sheath (booting failure) | Elongated/spindly growth, yellowish leaves due to iron toxicity, foul smell from roots (anaerobic decay), algae growth on water surface, root rotting (brown/black roots) |
| Wheat | Leaf wilting (leaves droop and curl), bluish-green tinge on leaves, leaf tip drying/burning, premature ear emergence (small ears), white/empty heads (chaffy grains) | Yellowing of lower leaves, stunted growth, root rotting (brown discoloration), leaf spot diseases increase, lodging (plants fall over) |
| Cotton | Wilting of top leaves during midday (temporary wilting → permanent wilting), dark green then reddish leaves, premature shedding of squares and young bolls, short internodes, "cut-out" (stops producing new fruiting points) | Yellowing of lower leaves, leaf drop, root rot (Phytophthora), reduced boll size, secondary infections increase, stunted growth with dark green waxy leaves |
| Tomato | Wilting (recovers at night initially, then permanent), leaf curling upward, flower drop, blossom end rot (black/brown bottom of fruit), small and misshapen fruits, thick/leathery leaves | Yellowing from lower leaves upward, root rot, fruit cracking, Phytophthora wilt, reduced fruit flavor, epinasty (downward curling of leaf petioles) |
| Banana | Leaf folding along midrib (umbrella collapse), yellowing of older leaves from margin inward, delayed bunch emergence, thin and curved fingers, premature ripening of fruit | Yellowing of all leaves, pseudostem softening at base, root rot (Erwinia), rhizome rotting, toppling of plant, foul smell from base |
| Maize | Leaf rolling (taco-shaped) starting at lower leaves, greyish-green color, tassels emerge before silks (ASI — Anthesis-Silking Interval increases), barren cobs (poor kernel set), firing (lower leaf death) | Yellowing leaves, "brace root" development above soil, purpling of stems/leaves, stunted growth, root rot, increased stalk rot susceptibility |

### Water Stress Quick-Action Guide for Farmers

| Stress Level | Visual Indicator | Urgency | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🟢 Mild | Slight midday wilting (recovers by evening) | Low — irrigate within 2-3 days | Schedule next irrigation |
| 🟡 Moderate | Persistent wilting, leaf rolling, color change | Medium — irrigate within 24 hours | Irrigate immediately next morning (early AM is best) |
| 🔴 Severe | Permanent wilting, leaf drying, flower/fruit drop | URGENT — irrigate NOW | Emergency irrigation. Apply 50% of normal amount first (shock irrigation can damage roots). Follow up with full irrigation 12 hours later |
| ⚫ Critical | Leaf death, plant collapse, complete wilting | Crop may be unrecoverable | Salvage what possible. Irrigate and assess in 48 hours. Consider replanting if within season window |

## 7. Advanced Water Analytics & Decision Framework

> This section enables the AI to provide data-driven irrigation recommendations combining weather, soil, crop stage, and water availability.

### 7A. Irrigation Decision Matrix

The AI should evaluate these 5 factors before recommending irrigation:

| Factor | Data Source | Weight | How AI Uses It |
|---|---|---|---|
| Crop growth stage | Farmer profile (sowing date + crop) | 30% | Determines base water requirement (Section 3 tables) |
| Current weather + 5-day forecast | Weather API (IMD/OpenWeather) | 25% | If rain >20mm expected in 2 days → delay irrigation. If temp >40°C → increase water by 15-20% |
| Soil type | Farmer profile (location/soil) | 20% | Determines irrigation frequency and depth (Section 4E) |
| Days since last irrigation/rain | Farmer input / weather history | 15% | Calculate cumulative ET since last water application |
| Water availability | Farmer input (well/canal/tank) | 10% | If water scarce → recommend deficit irrigation or priority crops |

### 7B. Evapotranspiration (ET)-Based Irrigation Scheduling

**Formula:** Irrigation Depth (mm) = ETc × Days since last irrigation − Effective Rainfall

Where:
- **ETc** = Crop Evapotranspiration = Kc × ETo
- **Kc** = Crop coefficient (varies by growth stage — see Section 1A)
- **ETo** = Reference Evapotranspiration (from weather data)
- **Effective rainfall** = 80% of actual rainfall (for medium soils)

**Regional ETo Values for India (mm/day, annual average):**

| Region | Summer (Mar-May) | Monsoon (Jun-Sep) | Winter (Oct-Feb) |
|---|---|---|---|
| North India Plains (Punjab, UP, Haryana) | 6.0-8.0 | 4.0-5.5 | 2.0-3.5 |
| Central India (MP, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh) | 6.5-8.5 | 4.0-5.0 | 2.5-4.0 |
| South India (TN, Karnataka, AP, Telangana) | 6.0-8.0 | 4.5-6.0 | 3.0-4.5 |
| Western India (Gujarat, Rajasthan) | 7.0-10.0 | 4.5-6.0 | 3.0-5.0 |
| Eastern India (WB, Odisha, Bihar, Jharkhand) | 5.5-7.5 | 3.5-5.0 | 2.0-3.5 |
| North-East India | 4.0-6.0 | 3.0-4.5 | 2.0-3.0 |
| Coastal Regions | 5.0-7.0 | 4.0-5.5 | 3.0-4.0 |

### 7C. Water Budget Calculator

**For AI to compute per farmer:**

```
Inputs:
  - Crop type
  - Field area (acres/hectares)
  - Sowing date
  - Soil type
  - Irrigation source (well, canal, tank, borewell)
  - Well discharge rate (litres/hour) or canal turn duration

Calculations:
  1. Total crop water need (mm) → from Section 1 table
  2. Effective monsoon contribution (mm) → from regional rainfall data
  3. Net irrigation requirement (mm) = Total need - Effective rainfall
  4. Volume of water needed (litres) = Net requirement (mm) × Area (m²) × 10
  5. Number of irrigations = Net requirement / Depth per irrigation
  6. Pumping hours needed = Total volume / Well discharge rate
  7. Diesel/electricity cost = Pumping hours × rate

Output:
  - Season-long irrigation plan (dates + volumes)
  - Estimated irrigation cost (₹)
  - Water-saving potential with drip/sprinkler (₹ saved)
```

### 7D. Climate-Smart Irrigation Adjustments

**Temperature-Based Adjustments:**
| Temperature Range | Adjustment to Base Water Requirement |
|---|---|
| < 20°C | Reduce by 15-20% |
| 20-30°C | Standard (no adjustment) |
| 30-35°C | Increase by 10-15% |
| 35-40°C | Increase by 20-30% |
| > 40°C (Heat wave) | Increase by 30-40% + irrigate in early morning/late evening only |

**Wind-Based Adjustments (for sprinkler irrigation):**
| Wind Speed | Action |
|---|---|
| < 8 km/h | Normal operation |
| 8-15 km/h | Increase overlap between sprinklers by 20% |
| > 15 km/h | DO NOT operate sprinklers — switch to surface/drip or wait |

**Humidity-Based Adjustments:**
| Relative Humidity | Impact |
|---|---|
| > 80% | Reduce irrigation by 10-15% (low evaporation) |
| 50-80% | Standard |
| < 50% | Increase by 10-20% (high evaporation, especially in arid zones) |

### 7E. Irrigation Efficiency Metrics (KPIs for the AI Dashboard)

| Metric | Formula | Target | What It Means |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Water Use Efficiency (WUE)** | Yield (kg) ÷ Water Applied (m³) | Varies by crop (see 1B) | How much crop per unit water |
| **Irrigation Efficiency** | Water used by plant ÷ Water applied × 100 | Drip: 90%, Sprinkler: 75%, Flood: 35% | System-level water delivery |
| **Conveyance Efficiency** | Water reaching field ÷ Water released from source × 100 | Lined canal: 85%, Unlined: 60%, Pipe: 95% | Distribution losses |
| **Water Productivity (₹)** | Crop value (₹) ÷ Water applied (m³) | Higher is better | Economic return per unit water |
| **Relative Water Supply (RWS)** | Total water supply ÷ Crop water demand | 1.0-1.2 (ideal) | >1.5 = wasting water, <0.8 = water stress |
| **Beneficial Water Fraction** | Water used for crop growth ÷ Total water applied × 100 | >80% for drip | Fraction of water that serves a productive purpose |

### 10F. How to Contribute to This Knowledge Base

**Improving data quality:**
1. **Validate crop water data:** Cross-check values against TNAU Agritech Portal + FAO CROPWAT calculations
2. **Update MSP and subsidy figures:** Check annually at farmer.gov.in (announced before each cropping season)
3. **Add local varieties:** Consult state agricultural university portals for state-specific recommendations
4. **Verify pesticide/chemical names:** Check registration at PPQS portal (ppqs.gov.in)
5. **Add farmer success stories:** Collect from KVK networks, Krishi Jagran, NIF

**Data Enhancement Opportunities:**
1. **Hyper-local irrigation data:** Integrate district-level IMD Agrimet advisories (updated weekly)
2. **Groundwater monitoring:** Link CGWB data for borewell sustainability assessment by district
3. **Satellite imagery:** Use ISRO Bhuvan NDVI data to validate crop water stress indicators
4. **Weather API integration:** Real-time ET calculation using OpenWeather/IMD API data
5. **Market price correlation:** Link eNAM prices with irrigation cost to compute water productivity (₹/m³)
6. **Multilingual content:** All data should be available in Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Marathi, Bengali, Gujarati, Punjabi for farmer accessibility

## Quick Reference Summary

### Irrigation Method Comparison at a Glance

| Method | Water Efficiency | Setup Cost/Acre | Best For | Water Saved vs Flood |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Flood | 30-40% | ₹0 | Rice (paddy) | Baseline (0%) |
| Furrow | 45-60% | ₹2,000-5,000 | Sugarcane, vegetables | 15-25% |
| Sprinkler | 65-80% | ₹15,000-40,000 | Wheat, groundnut, pulses, millets | 30-40% |
| Drip | 85-95% | ₹35,000-75,000 | Cotton, banana, sugarcane, vegetables, orchards | 40-60% |
| SRI (Rice) | 70-80% | ₹5,000-8,000 (weeder) | Rice only | 25-50% |

### Top 5 Rules for Indian Farmers (AI Should Emphasize)

1. **"Right amount at the right time"** — Irrigate based on crop stage, not on a fixed calendar
2. **"Morning irrigation is gold"** — Water before 9 AM to minimize evaporation losses
3. **"CRI in wheat, Flowering in rice"** — These are non-negotiable irrigation stages
4. **"Drip saves your borewell"** — Drip irrigation = 50% less pumping = borewell lasts longer
5. **"Stop watering onion before harvest"** — 15-20 days dry period before harvest prevents rotting in storage
